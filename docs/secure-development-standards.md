## 1. Purpose and scope

This is the secure development standard for an **open-source software project intended for use in regulated environments, including healthcare** (handling of protected health information, PHI).

It is written to serve three audiences:

1. **The development team** — a consistent engineering bar to build to, across this and future projects.
2. **Deploying organizations** — both the maintainer's own organization and any other organization that adopts the open-source software, who need evidence that it was built and tested securely.
3. **Future projects** — this standard is **project-agnostic**; any new application can be developed under it without rewriting it.

**How the standard is structured.** The body (§2–§10) states requirements that apply to *any* application built under this standard. Each application records its own specifics — technology stack, applicable verification scope, the interface mechanisms it implements — in a **per-project Applicability Profile**. MEFOR's profile is Appendix A; future projects add their own (Appendix B, C, …).

**Companion standards.** Two companions extend this baseline. The [Secure AI-Assisted Development Standards](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md) governs *building with an AI coding assistant* (risk tiers, provenance, guardrails). The [Code Quality & Anti-Slop Standards](Code_Quality_Standards.md) governs *judging whether the resulting code is good, not "AI slop"* — an evidence-based rubric aligned to ISO/IEC 25010. This document states the security baseline both build on; the three are complementary (process → build → outcome).

**Open-source note.** The software is developed in the open. This standard, and the project's security attestations, are publishable so that adopters can rely on them or extend them for their own environment.

---

## 2. Shared responsibility

Because the software is built by one party and deployed by others, responsibilities split cleanly. Stating the split prevents either side from assuming the other has it covered.

| The **project** is responsible for | The **deploying organization** is responsible for |
|---|---|
| Secure development practices (§4) | Its own environment, host, and network security |
| Secure-by-default configuration | Identity, credential, and key management in its environment |
| Security testing and attestation of the software (§6) | Backups, disaster recovery, and availability |
| Vulnerability response and disclosure (§8) | Its own compliance program — HIPAA Security Rule obligations, risk assessments of the deployment, and Business Associate Agreements where applicable |
| Documentation and evidence (§9) | Operational monitoring, patching, and incident response |

**No certification or agreement is conferred by the software itself.** A deploying organization operates the software under *its own* programs; an attestation that the software was built securely is evidence for that organization's assessment, not a substitute for it.

---

## 3. How this maps to NIST (overview)

Three NIST publications cover three different questions. Together they form the standard:

| Question | NIST publication | Section |
|---|---|---|
| **How is the software built?** (secure development process) | SP 800-218 (SSDF) | §4 |
| **How is it tested?** (security testing methodology) | SP 800-115 | §6 |
| **What controls does it implement?** (security/privacy controls + HIPAA safeguards) | SP 800-66 Rev. 2 | §7 |

These are complementary to the **OWASP ASVS 5.0 Level 3** verification (source-assisted and hands-on; performed internally today, with an independent assessment as a best-practice pre-production add-on — ASVS itself does not require independence): ASVS verifies that the built application is secure; SSDF attests to how it was built; 800-66 maps the HIPAA safeguards.

### A note on claims and wording (read before publishing any claim)

NIST does **not** issue certificates for these frameworks. The project may **display alignment claims**, but words them honestly and backs them with evidence:

- **Use:** "Built to NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF)," "NIST SSDF–aligned," "tested per NIST SP 800-115," "controls mapped to NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2," "HIPAA-compliant deployment supported."
- **Do not use:** "NIST certified" or any phrasing implying a certificate exists.
- **Back every claim** with the implemented practice and its evidence (this standard, test reports, the ASVS attestation, the applicability profile). A self-attestation is a formal, legally significant declaration — only make it if it is true.
- A third-party assessor may **validate** an attestation; that raises its weight but is still not a NIST certificate.

## 4. Secure software development — NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF)

SSDF organizes secure development into four practice groups: **Prepare the Organization (PO)**, **Protect the Software (PS)**, **Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)**, and **Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)**. Requirements below apply to every project; project-specific tooling is recorded in the applicability profile.

### 4.1 Prepare the Organization (PO.1–PO.5)

- **Security requirements (PO.1).** Security requirements are documented (this standard plus each project's standing contract, e.g., a `CLAUDE.md` or equivalent) and treated as first-class alongside functional requirements. Captured as first-class specs, these requirements drive design and tests per **§5 (Spec-Driven Development)** — recommended.
- **Roles and responsibilities (PO.2).** Maintainer/reviewer roles are defined; security ownership is explicit; onboarding includes secure-development orientation.
- **Supporting toolchains (PO.3).** Source control; CI/CD with automated security checks (§6.2); dependency and secret scanning; pinned, integrity-verified dependencies.
- **Security check criteria (PO.4).** Pass/fail release gates are defined (§6.4); a release does not ship with unresolved high/critical findings.
- **Secure development environments (PO.5).** Disk-encrypted developer machines; **no real PHI in development or test** (synthetic or de-identified data only); least-privilege access to repositories and environments.

### 4.2 Protect the Software (PS.1–PS.3)

- **Protect code from unauthorized access/tampering (PS.1).** Branch protection, required reviews, least-privilege access; no direct commits to the main branch; signed commits where supported.
- **Verify release integrity (PS.2).** Releases are versioned and integrity-verifiable (checksums/signatures); a software bill of materials (SBOM) is generated per release.
- **Archive and protect releases (PS.3).** Each released version, its build inputs, and its SBOM are archived to support incident analysis and reproducibility.

### 4.3 Produce Well-Secured Software (PW.1, PW.2, PW.4–PW.9)

- **Secure design and threat modeling (PW.1–PW.2).** Each interface and component is threat-modeled; trust boundaries are identified and documented; designs are reviewed against the security requirements before build. The reviewed design artifact and its acceptance criteria are the spec; **§5** describes the recommended clarify/analyze gates applied before build.
- **Reuse well-secured components (PW.4).** Prefer vetted libraries; avoid rolling custom cryptography.
- **Secure coding practices (PW.5).** Mandatory:
  - **Input validation** — validate structure and content at every ingress; reject or quarantine malformed input rather than processing it. *(Example: HL7 message validation in MEFOR.)*
  - **Parameterized queries only** — no string-built SQL; use an ORM or parameterized statements throughout.
  - **Authentication & authorization** — enforce on every action; deny by default; interface mechanisms per §7.4.
  - **Web-service interfaces (REST and SOAP)** — authenticate every endpoint; validate and size-limit payloads against a schema; for SOAP/XML, disable external-entity resolution (XXE) and DTD processing; apply rate limiting and timeouts; never expose stack traces or sensitive data in fault responses.
  - **File-handler interfaces** — confine reads/writes to configured directories and canonicalize paths (reject `../` traversal and symlink escapes); validate file type and size by content, not extension; use atomic write-then-rename so partial files are never processed; least-privilege storage, never an executable or web-served path; never execute file contents; scan inbound files for malware where feasible; encrypt sensitive files at rest and securely delete after processing per retention.
  - **Cryptography** — TLS for all network communication; encryption at rest for sensitive data; approved algorithms and libraries; use FIPS-validated crypto where a deployment requires it.
  - **Secrets** — never in code, prompts, or commit history; sourced from environment/secret store; enforced by pre-commit and CI secret scanning.
  - **Error handling and logging** — fail closed; never log secrets or sensitive data; produce a tamper-evident, timestamped audit log.
- **Secure build configuration (PW.6).** Reproducible builds; security-relevant build/interpreter and dependency settings fixed in the pipeline.
- **Code review and analysis (PW.7).** Every change is peer-reviewed; static analysis (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) run in CI (§6.2). Review also confirms the change conforms to its spec's acceptance criteria — see **§5** (analyze, cross-artifact coverage); recommended.
- **Test executable code (PW.8).** A maintained automated test suite runs on every change; security test cases are included. Tests SHOULD trace to the spec's acceptance criteria (**§5**, executable acceptance criteria) so coverage is mechanical, not prose. Test *quality* — not just presence — is judged per the [Code Quality & Anti-Slop Standards](Code_Quality_Standards.md): behavior-verifying assertions over mock choreography, with mutation testing as *guidance*. Heed its **anti-metric rule** — **never gate quality on line-coverage % alone** (a gameable slop-hiding place); measure structure and behavior, not a single scoreboard.
- **Secure defaults (PW.9).** Ships secure-by-default (TLS on, encryption on, least-privilege accounts, verbose audit logging); insecure options require explicit, documented opt-in.

### 4.4 Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV.1–RV.3)

- **Identify on an ongoing basis (RV.1).** Continuous dependency monitoring; a defined intake channel for internally and externally reported issues (§8).
- **Assess, prioritize, remediate (RV.2).** Findings are triaged by severity with target remediation timelines (set per project in the profile); fixes are verified before closure.
- **Root-cause analysis (RV.3).** Significant vulnerabilities receive a root-cause review; systemic causes feed back into this standard.

## 5. Spec-Driven Development

The practices in this section are a **distilled synthesis** drawn from GitHub Spec Kit, AWS Kiro, and BDD / Specification-by-Example — **not adoption of any external tool or standard, and not a certification.** They formalize habits the reference project already practices. **They are recommended (SHOULD), adopted incrementally**; they add no new blocking release gate, and they do not weaken or replace any security requirement in §4 or §6. Where a practice maps to an SSDF practice, that mapping is noted.

### 5.1 The spec stack (constitution → decisions → requirements → tasks → verification)

Spec-driven development treats the artifacts that describe *what* a change must do and *why* as first-class, versioned, and connected — so design, build, and verification trace back to an agreed specification rather than to memory. The recommended structure is five layers, each mapping to an SSDF practice. The framing here is generic; the concrete MEFOR artifacts that fill each layer are recorded in Appendix A.7.

| Layer | What it holds | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| **Constitution** | The standing, versioned contract of invariants + vocabulary every later artifact honors. | PO.1 |
| **Decisions** | Architecture decision records with a build-gating lifecycle (proposed → accepted → superseded/rejected). | PW.1–PW.2 |
| **Requirements / sequencing** | Numbered, ID'd requirement items, cross-referenced by decisions. | PO.1 |
| **Tasks** | Decomposition of decisions/requirements into work items / lanes / gates. | PW.1–PW.2 |
| **Verification** | Automated checks + human conformance reviews that test/inspect against the spec. | PW.7 (review), PW.8 (test) |

A project SHOULD keep these five layers present and connected; the recommended connections are described in §5.3–§5.5.

### 5.2 EARS acceptance criteria

A change's behavioral acceptance criteria SHOULD be written in **EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)** — a small, constrained grammar that turns prose requirements into testable, unambiguous statements. EARS offers five templates:

| Template | Form |
|---|---|
| Ubiquitous (always-on) | THE SYSTEM SHALL `<response>` |
| Event-driven | WHEN `<trigger>` THE SYSTEM SHALL `<response>` |
| State-driven | WHILE `<state>` THE SYSTEM SHALL `<response>` |
| Unwanted behavior | IF `<condition>` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL `<response>` |
| Optional feature | WHERE `<feature>` THE SYSTEM SHALL `<response>` |

> **Example (event-driven).** WHEN a message fails strict validation, THE SYSTEM SHALL NAK (AR/AE) and record `ERROR` before any ingress row.

This fits the project's existing posture: the standing contract's invariants already read as SHALL-style statements, and each ASVS "Verify that X" requirement restates as an underlying "the system SHALL X" that EARS can express. EARS also maps cleanly onto the *technical* HIPAA safeguards (access control, audit, integrity, transmission security) the software implements — the administrative safeguards (§7.2) are organizational obligations, not behavioral system triggers, so they fall outside EARS's WHEN/WHILE/IF grammar. *(Lineage: AWS Kiro `requirements.md`; distilled, not adopted.)*

### 5.3 Requirement → design → tasks → test traceability

Each acceptance criterion SHOULD carry an **ID** linked to the test or fixture that exercises it, so coverage is **mechanical, not prose** — "which criteria are untested" becomes computable rather than a judgment call. The reference project already owns the pieces — decisions in ADRs, requirement IDs in the backlog, tasks in release/multisession plans — and the recommendation is to **connect** them: criterion ID → test/fixture link. *(Lineage: AWS Kiro requirements/design/tasks triad; distilled.)*

### 5.4 Clarify and analyze (lightweight, advisory)

Two lightweight checks are recommended, both explicitly **advisory, not hard gates**:

- **Clarify** — force ambiguity resolution before build, surfacing and answering open questions while they are still cheap to change. The project already has an informal version: the ADR **"To resolve on acceptance"** block.
- **Analyze** — automated cross-artifact consistency/coverage: does every acceptance criterion have a task and a test? does any artifact contradict the constitution's invariants?

These SHOULD be run as lightweight advisory checks. They introduce no new blocking release gate (cf. §6.4). *(Lineage: GitHub Spec Kit `specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement`; distilled.)*

### 5.5 Executable acceptance criteria (living documentation)

BDD / Specification-by-Example expresses acceptance criteria as Given/When/Then scenarios with concrete `(input → expected outcome)` example tables that **execute** as tests — so specification and verification cannot silently drift, and the spec doubles as living documentation. This fits naturally with EARS's WHEN/THEN phrasing, and the HL7 domain (well-defined inputs, well-defined dispositions) is well suited to example-driven verification. The concrete reference-project opportunity (detailed as R2 in Appendix A.7):

> A project's dry-run gate that already replays fixtures through the real graph but asserts only "didn't error" **SHOULD** be upgraded to assert an **expected disposition per fixture** (e.g. `PROCESSED` / `UNROUTED` / `FILTERED` / `ERROR`), turning it into an executable acceptance-criteria check.

*(Lineage: BDD / Specification-by-Example; distilled, not BDD-tool adoption.)*

### 5.6 Constitution as a first-class versioned artifact

A standing, versioned ruleset that all downstream artifacts respect is sound practice — it gives design, decisions, and verification a single source of invariants and vocabulary to honor. The reference project already has it: the project's standing contract / constitution ([`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)). The only addition is that the **analyze** check (§5.4) can verify no artifact violates the constitution's invariants. *(Validates existing practice; nothing external adopted.)*

> **Recommendation pointer.** For the reference project's existing spec stack and three concrete, recommended improvements (R1–R3), see Appendix A.7.

## 6. Security testing and assessment — NIST SP 800-115

Testing follows the methodology of NIST SP 800-115 (*Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment*): review techniques, target identification and analysis, and target vulnerability validation.

### 6.1 Testing tiers

| Tier | What | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Automated (in CI/CD) | SAST, SCA/dependency scan, secret scanning, unit/integration security tests | Every commit / build |
| Dynamic | DAST / authenticated testing of the running app | Per release and periodically |
| Independent review | Third-party source-code review + penetration test per 800-115 — the project's own pre-production gate (§6.3), **not** an ASVS mandate. It covers the **OWASP ASVS 5.0 Level 3** verification, which is source-assisted/hands-on and may be performed internally; the external engagement adds independence + credibility. | Before a production release; after major change; periodically thereafter |

### 6.2 Internal testing (continuous)

- SAST and SCA run automatically; builds fail on new high/critical findings.
- Secret scanning runs pre-commit and in CI; the full git history is kept clean of secrets, credentials, keys, and any sensitive data.
- Security-focused test cases (authn/authz, input validation, error handling) are part of the standard suite.

### 6.3 OWASP ASVS 5.0 Level 3 — scope

The independent review is scoped to **OWASP ASVS version 5.0.0** (released May 2025), **Level 3**:

- **Version-pinned citation.** Requirements are cited as `v5.0.0-<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`; identifiers changed substantially from 4.0.x, so the version is always stated.
- **Scale and level model.** ~350 requirements across **17 chapters**. Levels are **cumulative** — L3 includes all of L1 and L2. **MessageFoundry targets Level 3** (defence-in-depth for the highest-assurance contexts), chosen above the usual L2 norm because the engine carries PHI; L1 and L2 form the cumulative baseline and are assessed first.
- **Access required for L3.** L3 is a white-box / hybrid review: the assessor needs source code, developer access, documentation, and an authenticated test instance running **synthetic, non-PHI** data.
- **Documented Security Decisions (new in 5.0).** Each chapter opens with a requirement to document *how* its controls are applied and *why*. This standard, the per-interface threat models (PW.1), and the secure-default baseline (PW.9) serve as that documentation. **Each project documents which chapters are in scope and records exclusions with justification** — see the applicability profile. (Documenting exclusions is itself an ASVS practice.)
- **5.0 modernizations to honor.** Cryptography (V11) reflects current guidance, including post-quantum considerations; authentication and password rules (V6) align with NIST SP 800-63; ASVS 5.0 scopes to **applications and APIs** (host/network infrastructure is the deployer's responsibility, §2).

**The 17 chapters (v5.0.0):** V1 Encoding and Sanitization · V2 Validation and Business Logic · V3 Web Frontend Security · V4 API and Web Service · V5 File Handling · V6 Authentication · V7 Session Management · V8 Authorization · V9 Self-contained Tokens · V10 OAuth and OIDC · V11 Cryptography · V12 Secure Communication · V13 Configuration · V14 Data Protection · V15 Secure Coding and Architecture · V16 Security Logging and Error Handling · V17 WebRTC.

*Per-project chapter applicability (in scope / excluded with justification) is recorded in the applicability profile.*

### 6.4 Release gates

A production release requires: passing automated checks, no unresolved high/critical findings, current independent-review status (or a documented risk acceptance), and updated evidence (§9).

---

## 7. Security/privacy controls and HIPAA safeguards — NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2

For deployments that handle PHI, the software implements security and privacy controls — verified against **OWASP ASVS 5.0** (§6.3) — and maps them to the HIPAA Security Rule using NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2 (*Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule: A Cybersecurity Resource Guide*). *(A non-PHI deployment may scope the HIPAA mapping out; the control areas still apply.)*

### 7.1 Applied control areas

These control areas summarize the software's security posture. Each is verified through the OWASP ASVS 5.0 chapter(s) noted (§6.3) and produced by the secure-development practices of §4.

| Control area | Applied to the software | ASVS 5.0 chapter |
|---|---|---|
| **Access control** | Least-privilege, role-based access; deny by default | V8 Authorization |
| **Authentication** | Authenticated access enforced on every action; strong credential handling; interface mechanisms per §7.4 | V6 Authentication (V9/V10 when tokens/OAuth are introduced) |
| **Audit & accountability** | Tamper-evident, timestamped audit logging; no sensitive data in logs | V16 Security Logging and Error Handling |
| **Communications & data protection** | TLS in transit; encryption at rest; trust-boundary enforcement | V11 Cryptography; V12 Secure Communication; V14 Data Protection |
| **System & information integrity** | Input validation; flaw remediation (RV); message/data integrity and durability | V1/V2 Validation; V15 Secure Coding and Architecture |
| **Configuration management** | Version control, reviewed changes, secure-default configuration, SBOM | V13 Configuration |
| **Contingency** | Backup/restore and replay capability *(deployer operates DR in their environment, §2)* | — *(operational; deployer)* |
| **Risk assessment** | Vulnerability assessment by the project; deployment risk assessment by the deployer | §4.4 (RV); §7.3 |
| **Secure acquisition** | Secure development practices (§4) and vetted third-party components | V15; §4 |

### 7.2 HIPAA Security Rule safeguard mapping (via 800-66 Rev. 2)

| HIPAA safeguard | Representative requirement | Software implementation | ASVS 5.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Administrative** | Security management, risk analysis, workforce/access management | This standard; least-privilege access; *deployer's risk analysis* | V8, V15 |
| **Physical** | Facility and device controls | *Deployer's environment* | (Deployer) |
| **Technical — Access Control** | Unique user ID, authentication, automatic logoff | Authenticated, role-based access; session controls | V6, V7, V8 |
| **Technical — Audit Controls** | Record and examine activity | Tamper-evident, timestamped audit log | V16 |
| **Technical — Integrity** | Protect data from improper alteration/destruction | Input validation; durable, ordered processing | V1, V2 |
| **Technical — Transmission Security** | Protect data in transit | TLS for all sensitive transport | V12 |
| **(Addressable) Encryption** | Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit | Encryption at rest and in transit | V11, V14 |

### 7.3 Deployment risk assessment

Each deploying organization conducts its own HIPAA Security Risk Assessment of the deployment (mapped to 800-66 Rev. 2). The project supplies evidence (§9) to support it; it does not replace it.

### 7.4 Interface authentication standard

Integration software authenticates **systems, not people**, on its interfaces. Each connection uses the strongest mechanism the partner system supports, drawn from the hierarchy below; the mechanism, scope, and credential reference for every connection are recorded in its connection definition. (Maps to ASVS V6/V9/V10/V12; HIPAA person-or-entity authentication and transmission security.) *Which mechanisms a given project implements is recorded in its profile.*

**Preferred — system-to-system:**

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS).** Client-certificate authentication over **TLS 1.2+ (prefer 1.3)** with strong cipher suites; validate the full chain to a trusted CA, check revocation (OCSP/CRL), rotate certificates before expiry. Where tokens are also used, prefer **sender-constrained (mTLS-bound) access tokens** (ASVS 5.0 V10).
- **OAuth 2.0 client-credentials grant.** The default for machine-to-machine API auth. Prefer **asymmetric client authentication (`private_key_jwt`)** over shared secrets; issue short-lived, per-connection scoped tokens; validate issuer, audience, expiry, and scope on every request.
- **SMART on FHIR (Backend Services).** For any FHIR REST interface, authenticate using the SMART **Backend Services** profile — OAuth 2.0 client-credentials with a **signed JWT client assertion** and `system/` scopes; validate granted scopes against the requested operation.

**Directory / enterprise integration (e.g., Active Directory):**

- **Run under a least-privilege service account — preferably a group-Managed Service Account (gMSA)** on Windows/AD — so the password is auto-rotated and never stored in configuration.
- **Use Kerberos / Integrated Windows Authentication**; prefer Kerberos over NTLM (disable NTLM where feasible) with correct SPNs.
- **Authenticate to databases with integrated authentication** (the service account) rather than a stored database password, where supported.
- **Perform directory lookups over LDAPS (LDAP over TLS) only** — never cleartext LDAP; bind with a least-privilege account.
- **Map roles to directory security groups** for centralized RBAC; if human operators authenticate, **federate to the enterprise identity provider (AD FS / Entra ID) via OIDC or SAML** rather than a local user store.

**Legacy / interoperability tier** *(supported, least-preferred, documented per connection):* HTTP Basic over TLS, per-connection API keys, or SOAP **WS-Security** (UsernameToken or, preferably, X.509 certificate tokens with message-level signing). Always over TLS; credentials vaulted, scoped per connection, and rotated. Used only when a partner system cannot support a preferred mechanism, with the exception recorded.

**Across all mechanisms:** TLS everywhere (no cleartext sensitive transport); credentials and keys in a secret store, never in code or config; per-connection least privilege; and per-connection IP allowlisting / network segmentation as defense-in-depth.

---

## 8. Open-source project security

Because the software is developed in the open and adopted by others, the project also maintains:

- **Repository hygiene.** No secrets or sensitive data ever committed; the full history is scanned and kept clean. A clear `LICENSE`.
- **Coordinated vulnerability disclosure.** A published `SECURITY.md` with a private reporting channel and a disclosure timeline; reported issues feed the RV process (§4.4).
- **Signed, verifiable releases.** Release artifacts are signed and accompanied by an SBOM (PS.2), so adopters can verify provenance and integrity.
- **Contribution review.** All external contributions are security-reviewed before merge; signed commits / DCO required; maintainers gate merges; dependency provenance is checked.
- **Adopter guidance.** A deployment/hardening guide so adopters can stand the software up securely and meet their §2 responsibilities.

---

## 9. Evidence and attestation

The project maintains a current evidence set so any claim is backed:

- This **Secure Development Standards** document and each project's standing contract.
- **SSDF practice evidence** (toolchain configuration, review records, SBOMs, secure-default settings).
- **Test results** — CI security-scan history; the independent **OWASP ASVS 5.0 Level 3** report and re-test results.
- **Per-project applicability profile** (Appendix A and onward).
- A **claims register** recording each published claim, its wording, and the evidence behind it.

**Attestation posture.** The software is self-attested as NIST SSDF–aligned, tested per NIST SP 800-115, verified against OWASP ASVS 5.0 Level 3, and built to support HIPAA-compliant deployment (controls mapped to NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2). Third-party validation of the SSDF attestation and the ASVS 5.0 Level 3 assessment raises the weight of these claims. **Attestations are published with releases** so adopters can rely on them; each adopter still performs its own deployment risk assessment (§7.3). None of these is a NIST certificate; displayable certificates (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HITRUST) are a separate, organization-level track.

## Appendix A — Applicability Profile: MessageFoundry (MEFOR)

*The first project under this standard. Future projects add their own profile (Appendix B, C, …) using the same headings.*

### A.1 Project summary

MessageFoundry (MEFOR) is an open-source **HL7 v2.x interface engine** — a candidate alternative to commercial engines (Corepoint, Mirth Connect, Rhapsody, Cloverleaf). It routes and transforms clinical messages between systems.

**Technology stack:** Python 3.14+, FastAPI/uvicorn, aiosqlite/SQLite (WAL), `python-hl7`/`hl7apy`, PySide6 (desktop UI), Windows/PowerShell deployment; MLLP transport with native MLLP-over-TLS (opt-in via cert config — ADR 0002); application-layer AES-256-GCM encryption at rest (database-native where the backend provides it). Durable message store with FIFO/per-key ordering and dead-letter handling.

### A.2 Interfaces and surfaces

- **HL7 v2.x over MLLP** (inbound/outbound). **MLLP-over-TLS is built** (opt-in via per-connection cert config; optional client-cert **mTLS** via a trust anchor), with an off-loopback bind guard and a certificate-expiry monitor — ADR 0002 / WP-13b. Loopback-bound by default; IP allowlisting as additional defense-in-depth.
- **REST and SOAP** web-service interfaces — **outbound destinations built** (per-connection bearer / Basic-over-TLS; SOAP WS-Security + XML-DSig per ADR 0015). A **generic inbound HTTP listener is built** (ADR 0023) as the substrate REST/SOAP-in ride on; ADR 0003/0004 framed the original non-HL7 transport + payload-agnostic ingress design.
- **Database** source (inbound poll) and destination — ADR 0003.
- **File-handler interface** (file-drop pickup / output).
- **PySide6 desktop client**, plus an **opt-in read-only web ops dashboard** served under `/ui`
  (`[api].serve_ui`, off by default — [ADR 0065](adr/0065-web-ops-dashboard.md)).

### A.3 OWASP ASVS 5.0 Level 3 — chapter applicability

| # | Chapter (v5.0.0) | In scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | Encoding and Sanitization | Yes | HL7 input validation, output encoding, parameterized SQL |
| V2 | Validation and Business Logic | Yes | HL7 structural/content validation; routing/business-rule checks |
| V3 | Web Frontend Security | **No** | No browser-delivered UI (PySide6 desktop + APIs); documented exclusion. Re-scope if a web/admin UI is added |
| V4 | API and Web Service | Yes | **Core surface** — the localhost engine API: authn/authz per endpoint, payload size limits, WS-Origin checks. REST/SOAP outbound destinations plus a **generic inbound HTTP listener** (ADR 0023); **XXE/DTD defenses apply when inbound XML / SOAP-IN body parsing is added** — no inbound XML attack surface yet |
| V5 | File Handling | Yes | File-handler interface: path confinement, content validation, atomic write-then-rename, malware scan, encryption at rest |
| V6 | Authentication | Yes | Per §7.4; align to NIST SP 800-63 |
| V7 | Session Management | Yes | API/UI session controls, timeout/logout |
| V8 | Authorization | Yes | Role-based, least-privilege, deny-by-default |
| V9 | Self-contained Tokens | **In scope when introduced; currently N/A** | No JWT/JOSE today — sessions are opaque, server-side, revocable tokens. Applies if/when JWT access tokens are added |
| V10 | OAuth and OIDC | **Partly active** | **Outbound** OAuth 2.0 client-credentials + SMART on FHIR Backend Services and a FHIR REST connector are built (ADR 0024/0043 — `transports/smart.py`/`fhir.py`). **Inbound** OAuth/OIDC (engine as OAuth resource server) remains N/A |
| V11 | Cryptography | Yes | At-rest encryption via **application-layer AES-256-GCM on PHI columns** (database-native where the backend provides it); argon2id passwords; approved algorithms; post-quantum awareness |
| V12 | Secure Communication | Yes | TLS / MLLP-over-TLS; mTLS for system-to-system |
| V13 | Configuration | Yes | Secure-by-default; secrets management; SBOM |
| V14 | Data Protection | Yes | PHI minimization, encryption, no PHI in logs |
| V15 | Secure Coding and Architecture | Yes | Threat modeling, secure design, vetted components |
| V16 | Security Logging and Error Handling | Yes | Tamper-evident audit log; fail-closed errors; no PHI/secrets in logs |
| V17 | WebRTC | **No** | Not applicable — no WebRTC; documented exclusion |

*In scope: 12 chapters active today (V1, V2, V4–V8, V11–V16). V10 (OAuth/OIDC) is now **partly active** — outbound OAuth 2.0 client-credentials / SMART on FHIR are built (ADR 0024); inbound OAuth/OIDC remains N/A. V9 (JWT) is in scope when JWT is introduced — currently N/A. Documented exclusions: V3, V17.*

### A.4 Interface authentication mechanisms

Recorded honestly against what is **built today** vs **designed-but-deferred** vs **aspirational/
planned** (§9: every claim is backed by evidence). The §7.4 hierarchy is the target; this is MEFOR's
current position on it.

**Built (in code today):**

- **System-to-system (data plane):** per-connection **HTTP Basic over TLS** and **bearer token / API
  key** (env-vaulted) on REST and SOAP **destinations**; **database** authentication via SQL login,
  **Windows Integrated (Trusted Connection)**, or **Microsoft Entra**, over an encrypted connection.
- **Outbound machine-to-service auth:** **OAuth 2.0 client-credentials** with a **signed-JWT client
  assertion** and the **SMART on FHIR Backend Services** profile (ADR 0024, `transports/smart.py`); a
  **FHIR REST connector** (`transports/fhir.py`, plus the read-only Handler `fhir_lookup` — ADR 0043);
  and **SOAP WS-Security** on the SOAP destination — `<wsse:UsernameToken>` + WS-Addressing/Timestamp
  and **XML-DSig X.509** signing over the WS-*-wrapped envelope (ADR 0015).
- **Transport TLS:** native **API HTTPS/WSS** and **MLLP-over-TLS** (TLS 1.2+, opt-in via cert config),
  with optional client-certificate **mTLS** (API `tls_client_ca_file`; MLLP `tls_ca_file`), an
  off-loopback bind guard, and a certificate-expiry monitor — ADR 0002 / WP-13a/13b.
- **Operator strong-auth (control plane):** native **RFC 6238 TOTP MFA** for **local** accounts
  (ADR 0002 WP-14, built 2026-06-17) — enrolled per user, enforced for the Administrator role via
  `[auth].require_mfa` and re-verified at the sensitive-operation step-up boundary; AD/Entra users'
  MFA is delegated to the IdP. Recovery codes are argon2id-hashed; the TOTP secret is store-cipher
  protected.
- **Operator / directory (control plane, not interface auth):** **LDAPS** directory bind
  (certificate-validated; cleartext `ldap://` refused fail-closed), **Kerberos / SPNEGO** Windows SSO,
  and **AD security-group → role** mapping for RBAC. These authenticate **human operators** to the
  console/API, not data-plane systems.

**Designed but deferred (ADR 0002 — build before off-loopback exposure):**

- **Federated SSO for operators (OAuth 2.0 / OIDC / SAML via Entra)** — gets a dedicated federated-SSO
  ADR when 0.2 design begins; today's operator directory auth is direct LDAPS bind + Kerberos SSO, not
  federation. (Native TOTP MFA, transport TLS, MLLP-over-TLS, and client-cert mTLS are all **built** —
  see above.)

**Aspirational / planned (not built, no ADR yet):**

- *None outstanding.* The items previously listed here — **OAuth 2.0 client-credentials**, **SMART on
  FHIR (Backend Services)**, and **SOAP WS-Security (UsernameToken / X.509)** — have since been **built**
  (ADR 0024 / ADR 0015; see the **Built** tier above). Inbound OAuth/OIDC with the engine as a resource
  server remains out of scope until a JWT/OIDC-bearer inbound is introduced.

> **gMSA** is a **deployment posture** (run the Windows service under a group-Managed Service Account),
> not an engine protocol — see `docs/SERVICE.md`. It is recommended, not enforced in code.

### A.5 Project-specific parameters

- **Remediation SLA windows** (RV.2) — **confirmed 2026-06-12: Critical ≤ 7 days, High ≤ 30 days,
  Medium ≤ 90 days** (Low: best-effort). Measured from triage; fixes verified before closure;
  coordinated disclosure after a fix is available. Published in [`.github/SECURITY.md`](../.github/SECURITY.md).
- **Applicable control set** — the tailored control baseline is confirmed per deployment with the
  deploying organization's security lead (the §7.1 control areas apply; deployment-specific tailoring
  is the deployer's, §2/§7.3).

### A.6 Documented deviations

Honest record of where MEFOR's *current* practice differs from the body of the standard, with the
compensating control (the standard requires exclusions/deviations be documented, §6.3).

- **Single-maintainer development (PO.2 / PW.7).** The project is solo-maintained today, so the
  standard's "every change is peer-reviewed" cannot mean a *human second reviewer*. Compensating
  controls: blocking automated review (bandit/semgrep SAST, pip-audit SCA, gitleaks), AI-assisted
  review, branch protection + required CI checks, and no direct pushes to `main`. Revisit when a
  second maintainer joins. **Detailed record:** the AI-assisted-review compensating control — and the
  full risk-tiered discipline for building with Claude Code — is operationalized in
  [`Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md`](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md), the companion standard
  that owns and expands this deviation.
- **Independent ASVS-L3 review & DAST (§6.3 / §6.4).** Not yet performed; a **dated risk acceptance**
  is in force while pre-1.0 and loopback-only, and the independent engagement is **required before any
  off-loopback/production exposure** — see `security/RELEASE-GATE.md`.
- **Federated operator SSO (§7.4).** API/WSS/MLLP **TLS and client-cert mTLS are built** (opt-in via
  cert config) and **native TOTP MFA for local accounts is built** (ADR 0002 WP-14); the remaining
  deferred operator-auth item is **federated SSO (OIDC/SAML via Entra)**, held safe by the fail-closed
  `127.0.0.1` bind guard. Federation gets a dedicated ADR before off-loopback exposure.
- **Mechanical requirement→test traceability (§5.3, recommended).** Not yet enforced: acceptance
  criteria are not uniformly ID'd and linked to tests, and the dry-run gate asserts only "didn't error"
  (R2). This is **not a deviation from a hard requirement** — §5 traceability is **recommended (SHOULD)**,
  adopted incrementally — but it is recorded here for honesty. Tracked as R1–R3 in §A.7.

**ASVS 5.0 L3 deferred items — accepted / deferred** (risk accepted **2026-06-16**, refreshed after
MFA + admin-defense landed **2026-06-17**; owner: project maintainer). Each is deferred-by-design behind
the fail-closed bind guard or off-loopback-conditional, with the compensating controls below. Detail +
build triggers: `security/ASVS-FAILS-REMEDIATION-PLAN.md`;
per-requirement verdicts: `security/ASVS-L3-ASSESSMENT.md`. Reviewed at
each release and on any trigger below. Those are maintainer-internal documents;
[`SECURITY-DOCS-POLICY.md`](SECURITY-DOCS-POLICY.md) explains what is withheld and what you can request.

- **6.3.3 — multi-factor authentication.** **Satisfied for local accounts** — native RFC 6238 TOTP MFA
  is **built** (ADR 0002 WP-14, 2026-06-17), enforced for the Administrator role via `[auth].require_mfa`
  at the step-up boundary; **AD/Entra-account MFA is delegated to the IdP** (the supported enterprise
  path). No longer a deferred Fail. *(Hardware/WebAuthn second factors are now **built** — browser
  WebAuthn passkeys as the phishing-resistant second factor at the step-up boundary, ADR 0068 / WP-14b,
  behind the `[webauthn]` extra.)*
- **4.1.5 — per-message digital signatures on the PHI data plane.** Deferred-by-design. Transport-level
  security (TLS 1.2+ floor) over a single-tenant on-prem network is the de-facto standard for HL7 v2
  interchange; per-message signing is rare in practice and reserved for partners that contractually
  require it. *Compensating controls:* TLS + trusted on-prem network, no untrusted intermediary on the
  supported model. *Build trigger:* a partner contract mandating a message-level signature, or an
  off-prem / shared-tenant / untrusted-intermediary deployment (SOAP XML-DSig per ADR 0015 §4a, or a
  detached JWS for HL7/JSON). *Design record:* [ADR 0018](adr/0018-per-message-signatures-accepted-risk.md).
- **8.4.2 — multi-layer administrative-interface defense.** **Built (2026-06-17, ADR 0002)** — WP-14 MFA
  is wired as a genuine second factor at the step-up boundary, plus a **new-client-IP contextual-risk
  signal** (`[auth].admin_new_ip_step_up`, default off) layered over deny-by-default RBAC and the
  fail-closed `127.0.0.1` bind guard. *Residual (delegated):* device-posture assessment is delegated to
  the deployment (a managed/attested host + an mTLS client cert terminated at the WP-15 reverse proxy),
  not done in-process.
- **12.1.4 — TLS certificate revocation (OCSP/CRL).** Off-loopback-conditional. *Compensating controls:*
  native API/WSS + MLLP TLS built with a pinned 1.2+ floor + a cert-expiry monitor; loopback default.
  *Build trigger:* off-loopback exposure → OCSP-must-staple / CRL, or documented delegation to the org
  PKI / TLS terminator (ADR 0002).
- **13.3.3 — key material in an HSM/vault.** Deferred-by-design. The store data key is loaded into engine
  memory for AES-256-GCM; an attacker able to read process memory already implies host compromise on a
  single-tenant box. *Compensating controls:* machine-bound DPAPI at rest, restricted service account,
  on-prem network, host volume encryption. *Build trigger:* off-prem / cloud / shared-tenant or a
  PHI-critical posture/mandate → the pluggable KeyProvider seam (KMS/Vault/HSM envelope decryption,
  BEYOND WP-BL3-04).
- **16.4.3 — off-box log / audit shipping.** Off-loopback-conditional. *Compensating controls:* the local
  `audit_log` is append-only, SHA-256 hash-chained, and read-gated; restricted host. *Build trigger:*
  off-loopback exposure → structured JSON logging + syslog/SIEM forwarding (BEYOND WP-BL3-20).

### A.7 Spec-driven development — existing stack and recommendations

MEFOR already operates the five-layer spec stack of §5; the layers exist but are not yet mechanically
connected. Recorded honestly below, with three recommended (SHOULD) improvements.

#### A.7.1 Existing spec stack (state accurately)

| Layer | MEFOR artifact | Notes | SSDF |
|---|---|---|---|
| Constitution | [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) | Always-loaded standing contract of invariants + vocabulary. | PO.1 |
| Decisions | [`adr/`](adr/) (`docs/adr/*.md`) | Build-gating lifecycle (`README.md`: Proposed = drafted, no code → Accepted = ratified, build may start → Superseded/Rejected; plus `Reserved` number-allocations and `Dropped`). **ADRs numbered through 0105; some numbers are Reserved/Dropped.** The house pattern includes Context / Decision / Options considered / Consequences / "To resolve on acceptance". | PW.1–PW.2 |
| Requirements / sequencing | [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) + [`FEATURE-MAP.md`](FEATURE-MAP.md) | Numbered requirement IDs (e.g. #20, #26, #34), cross-referenced by ADRs; each item names its originating review finding. | PO.1 |
| Tasks | `docs/releases/*-PLAN.md`, `docs/releases/MULTISESSION-PLAN-11.md` (current) | Decompose ADRs/backlog into per-worktree lanes, gates, per-window quartet re-check. | PW.1–PW.2 |
| Verification | `messagefoundry check` ([`../messagefoundry/checks.py`](../messagefoundry/checks.py)) + conformance reviews under `security/` | `validate` (required) + `dryrun` (required when `*.hl7` fixtures exist) + advisory ruff/mypy; reviews: `SDS-CONFORMANCE-REVIEW-*.md`, `ASVS-L3-ASSESSMENT.md`. | PW.8 (test); reviews → PW.7 |

PW.8 (test executable code) is the home of `messagefoundry check` (validate + dryrun); PW.7 (review/analyze) is the home of the conformance reviews and code review — do not collapse the two. The SDS conformance review already cites SSDF practice IDs natively (PS.2, PO.4, PW.1–PW.2), so this mapping is not a retrofit.

#### A.7.2 Recommendations (all **recommended / SHOULD**, advisory)

- **R1 — EARS "Acceptance Criteria" block on the ADR template.** Each ADR **SHOULD** carry an EARS "Acceptance Criteria" block, each criterion bearing an ID linked to its test or fixture. Doc-only, zero-code; formalizes the existing SHALL-style house register. *(Lineage: AWS Kiro requirements.md; distilled.)*
- **R2 — Make the dry-run gate executable-spec.** `messagefoundry/checks.py` **SHOULD** read an **expected disposition per fixture** (`PROCESSED` / `UNROUTED` / `FILTERED` / `ERROR`) and assert it, upgrading today's "didn't error" dry-run (`_check_dryrun` asserts only not-`ERROR`) into an executable acceptance-criteria check. **Backward-compatible:** a fixture with no declared expectation keeps today's not-`ERROR` semantics. *(Lineage: BDD / Specification-by-Example; distilled.)*
- **R3 — Promote clarify, add analyze.** The ADR **"To resolve on acceptance"** block **SHOULD** be promoted into an explicit **clarify** step (resolve ambiguity before `Accepted`), and an **analyze**-style advisory coverage check **SHOULD** verify that every **Accepted** ADR's acceptance criteria has a linked test, and that no artifact contradicts a `CLAUDE.md` invariant. **Advisory, not a hard gate** — it belongs in the advisory tier alongside `ruff`/`mypy`, not the required `validate`/`dryrun` tier. *(Lineage: GitHub Spec Kit pipeline; distilled.)*

## Version history

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | July 29, 2026 | **Code-quality companion added.** Cross-linked the new [Code Quality & Anti-Slop Standards](Code_Quality_Standards.md) (evidence-based anti-slop rubric, ISO/IEC 25010): a companion-standards pointer in §1 and a test-*quality* + anti-metric note at PW.8. No change to the SSDF / ASVS / HIPAA mappings or Appendix A. |
| 2.0 | June 24, 2026 | Restructured baseline around SSDF, spec-driven development, NIST SP 800-115 testing tiers and SP 800-66 Rev. 2 safeguards. Content carried forward unchanged at this baseline. The full prior changelog — MEFOR-specific drafts → genericization (project-agnostic, with an Appendix A applicability profile) → OWASP ASVS 5.0 Level 3 re-target → NIST SP 800-53 removal → §5 Spec-Driven Development addition and the §5–§9 → §6–§10 renumbering — is preserved in git history. |
