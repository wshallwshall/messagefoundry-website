# Running the Engine as a Windows Service

MessageFoundry runs as a long-lived background service via
[NSSM](https://nssm.cc) (the "Non-Sucking Service Manager"). NSSM wraps the
`messagefoundry serve` command: it starts the engine on boot, restarts it on crash,
and captures its output to rotating log files. Stopping the service sends Ctrl+C so the
engine drains its connections cleanly (the ASGI lifespan stops the engine in an orderly way).

This page covers the single-machine setup with the engine bound to loopback. If you
expose a listener beyond `127.0.0.1`, front it with TLS and an authenticated interface —
MessageFoundry supports mTLS, OAuth 2.0 client-credentials, and SMART-on-FHIR Backend
Services for interface authentication. See the
[architecture overview](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
for networked-deployment guidance.

## Prerequisites

1. **A Python virtual environment with the package installed.** From the repo root:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
   ```
   This puts `messagefoundry.exe` in `.venv\Scripts\` — the service points at it.
   For a **reproducible, pinned** deployment, install the locked, hash-verified dependency
   set first, then the package itself:
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
   .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e . --no-deps
   ```
   `requirements.lock` is the SHA-256-pinned dependency export, kept in sync and audited in CI.
2. **NSSM** — provisioned automatically. If `nssm.exe` isn't on `PATH` (or passed via
   `-NssmPath`), `install-service.ps1` downloads the pinned, SHA-256-verified release into
   `<DataDir>\bin\nssm.exe` and uses it. No manual install needed. (You can still pre-install
   it — `choco install nssm` or a download from <https://nssm.cc> — and it'll be used if found.)
3. **An elevated PowerShell** (Run as Administrator) — required to register a service. The
   admin console's Engine Status page can do this for you via **Install service…** (UAC prompt).

## Install

```powershell
# from repo root, elevated PowerShell
.\scripts\service\install-service.ps1 -Environment prod
```

`-Environment` is **required**: it selects which `environments/<name>.toml` value file the
engine resolves and the instance's PHI posture. `serve` refuses to start without it (no silent
default), so the install script refuses too — pass `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, or a custom name.
The console's **Install service…** button prompts for it.

Defaults:

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| Service name | `MessageFoundry` |
| Engine exe | `<repo>\.venv\Scripts\messagefoundry.exe` |
| Config dir | `<repo>\samples\config` |
| Active environment | *(required — `-Environment`)* |
| Data dir | `C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry` |
| Message store | `<DataDir>\messagefoundry.db` |
| Logs | `<DataDir>\logs\service.out.log`, `service.err.log` |
| Bind | `127.0.0.1:8765` |
| Log level | `INFO` |

Override any of them, e.g.:

```powershell
.\scripts\service\install-service.ps1 -Environment prod -Port 9000 -LogLevel DEBUG `
    -Config D:\hl7\config -DataDir D:\MessageFoundry
```

The install script is idempotent — re-running it reconfigures the existing service.

## Update to a new build (restart vs reinstall)

The service runs `<repo>\.venv\Scripts\messagefoundry.exe`. With the documented **editable**
install (`pip install -e .`), that exe imports straight from the repo source — so a running
service keeps the code it loaded **at process start**. To pick up new code (a pull, a branch
switch, a merge), just **restart** it (elevated):

```powershell
& C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry\bin\nssm.exe restart MessageFoundry
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
```

Because the install is editable, a restart runs **whatever branch is checked out** in the repo.

**Reinstall** instead when paths or flags change (port, config dir, data dir) or the service
definition drifted — the install script is idempotent (it stops and reconfigures in place):

```powershell
.\scripts\service\install-service.ps1 -Environment prod   # elevated; re-points the exe + AppParameters
& C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry\bin\nssm.exe start MessageFoundry
```

If the package was installed **non-editable** (a plain `pip install .`), the venv holds a
snapshot of the old code — run `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .` first, then restart.

## Start / stop / status

```powershell
nssm start  MessageFoundry
nssm status MessageFoundry
nssm stop   MessageFoundry      # Ctrl+C -> graceful connection shutdown (up to 15s)
nssm restart MessageFoundry
```

If `nssm` isn't on `PATH`, it's the auto-downloaded copy at `<DataDir>\bin\nssm.exe`
(e.g. `C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry\bin\nssm.exe`). You can also use the built-in
`sc.exe` / Services.msc once installed.

## Security hardening (recommended)

### Run as a least-privilege account

By default the service runs as **LocalSystem** — the most privileged local account. The engine
needs only **read** on the config directory and **read/write** on the data directory, so
LocalSystem grants far more than required and widens the blast radius of any compromise (for
example, a config module is executed in-process — see *Lock down the config directory* below).

Install under a dedicated low-privilege account instead. A **virtual service account** needs no
password and is the simplest option:

```powershell
.\scripts\service\install-service.ps1 -Environment prod -ServiceAccount "NT SERVICE\MessageFoundry"
```

When `-ServiceAccount` is supplied the install script **auto-grants the account exactly what it
needs**: read+execute on the config directory and read/write on the data directory (the manual
`icacls` lines below are only needed if you point the engine at directories outside those).
Omitting `-ServiceAccount` still works but prints a loud warning that the service is running as
LocalSystem.

```powershell
# only if config/data live outside the script-managed paths:
icacls "D:\hl7\config"                 /grant "NT SERVICE\MessageFoundry:(OI)(CI)RX"
icacls "C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry" /grant "NT SERVICE\MessageFoundry:(OI)(CI)M"
```

A domain **gMSA** or a dedicated local user works the same way (pass `-ServiceAccountPassword`
for a password-based account — it's taken as a `SecureString`). The store file itself is further
restricted to its owner at runtime; account choice governs who that owner is.

### Protect the store encryption key at rest

PHI columns are AES-256-GCM-encrypted at rest when a key is configured (see the
[PHI handling guide](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/PHI.md)).
The key is a base64 32-byte secret. Two ways to supply it:

- **Environment (cross-platform default).** Set `MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the service's
  environment (`nssm set MessageFoundry AppEnvironmentExtra MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...`).
  Simple, but the plaintext key sits in the service environment block, readable by any local
  administrator.
- **DPAPI-protected key file (Windows).** Keep the key in a file that Windows DPAPI binds to
  *this machine*, so a copied file is useless elsewhere and no plaintext key is in the
  environment:

  ```powershell
  # mint + protect a fresh key (machine scope, so the service account can read it at startup):
  messagefoundry protect-key --generate --out "C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry\store.key.dpapi"
  #   -> prints the base64 key ONCE to stderr; back it up offline (the file is machine-bound and
  #      unrecoverable if the host is lost), then point the engine at it:
  ```
  ```toml
  [store]
  encryption_key_file = "C:/ProgramData/MessageFoundry/store.key.dpapi"
  ```
  Then **unset** `MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (the env key takes precedence when both are set).
  The service account decrypts the file at startup; a missing, foreign, or unreadable file makes
  `serve` fail closed rather than store PHI unencrypted. `protect-key` already restricts the file
  to its owner; keep it under the data dir so the data-dir ACL covers it too. To rotate,
  `protect-key` a new key to the file and run `messagefoundry rotate-key` with the prior key in
  `MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEYS_RETIRED` (see the
  [PHI handling guide](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/PHI.md)).

> **External vault / managed identity.** DPAPI is the built-in on-box option. To source the key
> (or SQL/AD credentials) from an external secrets manager — Windows Credential Manager,
> HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault via a **managed identity**, or an AD **gMSA** for SQL/LDAP —
> fetch the secret in your service-start wrapper and export it as the corresponding `MEFOR_*`
> variable, or place the DPAPI key file via your provisioning tool. The engine reads only the
> environment and `encryption_key_file`; it does not call a vault directly.

### Lock down the config directory

`messagefoundry serve --config <dir>` and `POST /config/reload` **execute the Python** in the
config directory in-process, with the service account's privileges. The directory is therefore a
trust boundary: anyone who can write a `.py` file there can run code as the service.

- Restrict the config directory's ACL so only administrators / the service account can write it:
  ```powershell
  icacls "D:\hl7\config" /inheritance:r /grant "Administrators:(OI)(CI)F" "NT SERVICE\MessageFoundry:(OI)(CI)R"
  ```
- On POSIX hosts the loader additionally **refuses** to load from a group/world-writable
  directory or module file.
- `/config/reload` only loads from the startup `--config` directory and any directories listed in
  `[api].config_reload_roots` (see the
  [configuration reference](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md));
  an arbitrary path is rejected. Keep those roots admin-owned too.

## Verify it's running

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health        # -> {"status":"ok", ...}
```

Send a test message and confirm it flows through:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe samples\send_mllp.py samples\messages\adt_a01.hl7
```

Then check the log:

```powershell
Get-Content C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry\logs\service.out.log -Tail 20 -Wait
```

You should see uvicorn's startup banner and `wiring started: N inbound, N outbound
connection(s)`. On stop you should see `wiring stopped` and `engine stopping` —
confirmation of a clean shutdown. (A live config swap logs `wiring reloaded: ...`.)

## Logs

The engine logs to stdout/stderr with a stdlib `logging` setup (one timestamped UTC
stream), with a CR/LF log-injection filter and a PHI-redaction chokepoint on the
exception path (see the
[PHI handling guide](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/PHI.md)).
NSSM captures those streams to the files above and rotates them at ~10 MB. The engine also
exposes operational telemetry on a `/metrics` endpoint for scraping into your own monitoring
stack. As deployment guidance, **avoid raising the level to `DEBUG` in production**, since
verbose output may include message content.

**Restrict the log directory's ACL** so the captured stdout/stderr (operational data,
not message bodies) is readable only by administrators and the service account — NSSM's
files would otherwise inherit a broadly-readable `ProgramData` ACL:

```powershell
icacls "C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry\logs" /inheritance:r `
  /grant "Administrators:(OI)(CI)F" "NT SERVICE\MessageFoundry:(OI)(CI)M"
```

## Admin console (optional desktop shortcut)

This service is **headless**. Operators watch and run it from the **admin console** — a
separate desktop app (not part of the service) that connects over the localhost API. Its
Alerts and Dead-Letters views surface engine health and let operators triage failed messages.
Give them a double-click icon instead of a command line:

```powershell
pip install "messagefoundry[console]"            # into the engine venv
.\scripts\console\install-console-shortcut.ps1   # Desktop + Start-Menu icon (per-user; -AllUsers for machine-wide)
```

It launches the windowed `messagefoundry-console.exe`, connects to this service on
`http://127.0.0.1:8765`, and prompts for sign-in. Local console accounts use built-in
multi-factor authentication; enterprise users sign in through your identity provider via SSO
federation, with MFA enforced there. See the
[install guide](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/INSTALL-GUIDE.md)
under "Launching the admin console".

## Uninstall

```powershell
.\scripts\service\uninstall-service.ps1
```

This stops and removes the service. The log files and message store under `DataDir`
are left in place.

## Troubleshooting

- **Service won't start / exits immediately.** Read `service.err.log`. The most common
  cause is a bad path baked into the service (relative paths resolve to the *system*
  directory for a service account); re-run the install script, which resolves all paths
  to absolute.
- **Port already in use (e.g. 2575).** The sample config's inbound connection binds MLLP
  port `2575`. If a stray `messagefoundry serve` (or a second copy of the service) is already
  running, the listener fails to bind. Make sure only one instance runs:
  `Get-Process messagefoundry,python | Format-Table Id,ProcessName,Path`.
- **`/health` doesn't respond.** Confirm the service is `SERVICE_RUNNING`
  (`nssm status MessageFoundry`) and that nothing else owns port `8765`.
- **Permissions on the data dir.** The service runs as `LocalSystem` by default, which
  can read/write `C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry`. If you point `-DataDir` somewhere the
  service account can't write, startup fails — pick a writable location, or (recommended)
  install under a least-privilege `-ServiceAccount` and grant it read/write on the data dir
  (see *Security hardening* above).
