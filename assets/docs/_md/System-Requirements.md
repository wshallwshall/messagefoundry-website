# MessageFoundry — System Requirements

These are the minimum and recommended requirements for running the MessageFoundry (MEFOR)
engine, its message store, and the administration clients. The engine is a headless
Python/asyncio service; the operator console is a browser page served by the engine itself at `/ui`.

> **On the throughput figures.** MEFOR **does** publish a measured per-node throughput baseline:
> [`benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md`](benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md) is **canonical** for every measured
> figure, with [THROUGHPUT.md](THROUGHPUT.md) as the plain-language guide to reading it. What it
> publishes is a reproducible **method** plus numbers stamped "as measured on the reference config" —
> not a headline capacity number, because the durable-write path makes throughput hardware-dependent.
> The sizing tiers in [Sizing by message volume](#sizing-by-message-volume) are **derived from those
> published measurements**: every tier's peak rate traces to a named measured run, and its daily figure is
> that rate through a **stated duty cycle**, not `× 86,400`. They are still not guarantees — each one
> inherits its source run's hardware, **fan-out** and transform cost. Always establish your own baseline on
> production-like hardware before go-live (see [LOAD-TESTING.md](LOAD-TESTING.md), the synthetic load-test
> profiles in [`harness/load/`](../harness/load/), and [§ Capacity notes](#capacity-notes)).

## Hardware

| | Minimum (lab / low-volume pilot) | Recommended (single-node production) |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 4+ cores (transform throughput is per-core; one worker set per connection) |
| **Memory** | 4 GB | 8–16 GB |
| **Disk** | 10 GB free, any disk | **SSD**, 50+ GB or sized to your retention window, on a low-latency local volume |
| **Store volume** | — | Put the message store on a fast local disk (not a network share). Budget for **store + WAL growth**: the staged pipeline writes ~3× per message on the embedded store (see [write-amplification benchmark](benchmarks/step-b-write-amplification.md)). |

> The engine and store may share a host for a low-volume pilot. For production, run a **server
> database** (PostgreSQL or SQL Server) on its own host, sized by your DBA, and keep the engine
> host dedicated. For volume beyond one CPU core, see [Sizing by message volume](#sizing-by-message-volume).

### Hardware memory encryption — required for an ASVS **Level 3** PHI deployment

**Requirement.** A deployment claiming ASVS **Level 3** for PHI **must** run the engine on a host that
provides **full memory encryption** — **AMD SEV-SNP** (EPYC 7003 "Milan" or later) or **Intel TDX**
(5th Gen Xeon Scalable or later) — *and* must actually launch the engine's VM as a **confidential
guest** on that platform. Capable silicon that is not running the guest in confidential mode does not
satisfy it. This is [ASVS 11.7.1](adr/0152-in-use-data-protection-for-phi-platform-memory-encryption-attestation-asvs-11-7-1.md)
(*full memory encryption … protects sensitive data while it is in use*), and it exists because PHI is
**plaintext in process memory** for as long as the engine is parsing, routing and transforming it —
HL7 is `str` end to end, and no application-level control can encrypt the interpreter's heap.

**This is a procurement decision, and we say so plainly.** MessageFoundry cannot provide the property;
only the host can. On a host that does not provide it:

- the engine **still runs** — nothing here is a functional requirement, and every other PHI control
  (at-rest encryption, retention, audit, RBAC, transport) is unaffected;
- ASVS 11.7.1 is capped at **Partial**, not Pass, and that cap is a **hardware fact about your
  deployment**, not a gap in the software. Disclose it in your own assessment rather than working
  around it;
- an **exposed** PHI instance **warns at every start** until the decision is recorded —
  `[security].memory_encryption_operator_declared = true` is the operator's declaration that the host
  provides it. The engine **starts either way**: this is a host property, not a config error, and one no
  operator can satisfy on Windows, so refusing by default would break deployments over something they
  cannot change. An estate that has standardized on confidential-computing hosts can make the missing
  declaration fatal with `[security].require_memory_encryption_declaration = true` (default `false`).
  Loopback and synthetic instances are unaffected and silent. See
  [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) `[security]` and
  OFF-LOOPBACK-DEPLOYMENT.md.

**What the engine does and does not tell you.** `GET /security/posture` carries a **report-only**
platform read-out (`memory_encryption_self_reported_capability` / `..._self_reported_active` /
`..._self_reported_mechanism` / `memory_encryption_readout_source`). On Linux it reads `/proc/cpuinfo`
flags for *capability* and `/dev/sev-guest` / `/dev/tdx_guest` presence for *activation*; on **Windows
every field is `null`** (see below). **No value of any of those fields satisfies 11.7.1** — they are
values the host OS emits about itself, and 11.7.1 exists precisely because that host may be the
adversary. Only a CPU-signed attestation report verified against the silicon vendor's root PKI would be
evidence, and **that is not built**. The response states this itself in `memory_encryption_note`, so the
limitation travels with any copy of the posture body. The engine measures and reports; your deployment
determines the verdict.

**Availability on today's on-premises platforms (verified 2026-07-22).** For a **Windows** engine host —
the primary supported platform — this requirement is presently **unmeetable on-premises**, and the
blocker is the hypervisor, not the CPU:

| Platform | Confidential guest for a **Windows** engine VM |
|---|---|
| **Hyper-V on-premises** (Windows Server 2019–2025) | ⛔ None. Windows Server 2025 ships no confidential VM; the vNext Insider "Trusted Launch" (Secure Boot + vTPM) is **not** memory encryption. |
| **VMware ESXi 9.0** | ⚠️ SEV-SNP is a *Limited Availability* release and its guest requirements are stated in Linux-kernel terms; Windows is not listed as a supported SEV-SNP guest. |
| **Azure / Azure Local confidential VMs** | ✅ SEV-SNP and TDX with Windows Server guests (a Microsoft paravisor supplies what a Windows guest needs). |
| **Linux guests on KVM / AWS / GCP / ESXi 9** | ✅ Where the host is SEV-SNP/TDX-capable and the guest is launched confidential. |

So a Windows on-prem deployment is honestly capped at **Partial** today, and a Linux or Azure
confidential-VM deployment is the route to the hardware property. Plan hardware refresh accordingly —
SEV-SNP needs EPYC 7003+ and TDX needs 5th Gen Xeon Scalable+, which is newer than much of a typical
5–7-year hospital server refresh cycle.

## Operating systems

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| **Windows Server 2022 / 2025** | ✅ Primary supported & serviced platform (Windows-service deployment via NSSM) |
| Windows Server 2019 | ✅ Supported |
| Windows 10 / 11 | ✅ Supported (development, pilot, test-harness host) |
| **Linux** (modern x86-64 distributions) | ✅ Engine supported (cross-platform Python); no bundled service installer — run under systemd yourself |
| macOS | ⚠️ Development / test-harness use only |

## Runtime

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Python** | **3.14**, 64-bit (the only supported runtime; CI-validated on Linux + Windows Server 2022 + 2025, the primary deploy target) |
| Service manager (Windows) | **NSSM** (auto-provisioned, SHA-256-pinned, by the installer; or pre-staged). Requires administrator / elevation to register the service. |
| C compiler | Not required for the default install (runtime dependencies ship as wheels) |

## Databases (message store)

| Database | Status | Driver / prerequisite |
|---|---|---|
| **SQLite (WAL)** | ✅ Default, bundled — single-node | None (`aiosqlite`, in-process) |
| **PostgreSQL 13+** | ✅ Production | `messagefoundry[postgres]` extra (`asyncpg` — no OS dependency; ships compiled wheels) |
| **Microsoft SQL Server 2022 / 2025** | ✅ Production | `messagefoundry[sqlserver]` extra (`aioodbc`) **plus the OS-level Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server** (18.5+ covers both majors). Read-Committed Snapshot Isolation (RCSI) recommended. SQL Server 2025 requires an AVX-capable CPU. |
| MySQL / Oracle | ⛔ Not supported (roadmap) | — |

> The embedded SQLite store needs no setup and suits pilots and single-node deployments. A
> **server database is greenfield-only** — there is no in-place migration from a populated SQLite
> store; drain and cut over. The DB tier owns its own backup, HA, and (SQL Server) TDE / purge
> maintenance. A server database is also the **concurrency / scale substrate** — see below.

## Administration clients

| Client | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Web console** (the operator UI) | A modern browser — **nothing to install on the operator's machine.** The engine serves the console same-origin under `/ui` from its own FastAPI app ([ADR 0065](adr/0065-web-ops-dashboard.md)), **on by default** since [ADR 0143](adr/0143-web-console-on-by-default-disableable-with-loopback-secure-context-browser-hardening.md) (`[security].serve_web_console`; set it to `false` for a JSON-API-only deployment). It ships as a separately-versioned wheel, `messagefoundry-webconsole`, mounted in-process. This is the **sole operator console** — the PySide6 desktop console was retired ([ADR 0032](adr/0032-console-desktop-launch.md)). |
| **VS Code extension** | Visual Studio Code (current stable) — route wizard, validate-on-save, test bench, stage→promote. |
| Test harness — *optional, not needed to run the engine* | The standalone synthetic send/receive/load harness (`python -m harness`) is the **only** PySide6 (Qt) surface left. It ships as its **own distribution**, released in lockstep with the engine and deliberately **not** included in the engine wheel: `pip install messagefoundry-harness` (which pulls `messagefoundry[harness]`, i.e. PySide6). Windows / Linux / macOS, a separate process reaching the engine only over the HTTP API. It is a **testing tool** — an engine host that does not run it needs no Qt and no GUI at all. |

## Network & ports

| Purpose | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine API** (HTTP + WebSocket) | `127.0.0.1:8765` | **Loopback by default**, authentication-required. **In-process TLS is built and opt-in** (WP-13a, [ADR 0002](adr/0002-phase2-transport-security-and-strong-auth.md)): set `[api].tls_cert_file` (plus `tls_key_file` when the key is a separate PEM) and the engine terminates TLS in uvicorn, so the API **and** the `/ws/stats` WebSocket serve `https`/`wss`. TLS **1.2 floor** (`tls_min_version` — `1.2` or `1.3`), optional `tls_ciphers`, and **opt-in mTLS** via `tls_client_ca_file` (a client certificate is then required and verified). A **TLS-terminating reverse proxy** remains the supported alternative (`tls_terminated_upstream` + `trusted_proxies`). An off-loopback bind needs one of the two — and **neither branch starts a stock instance on its own**. Because the engine performs no OCSP/CRL revocation check, in-process TLS off loopback is refused (**exit 2**) unless you also set `MEFOR_TLS_REVOCATION_ATTESTED=1` — an environment variable, not a TOML key ([ADR 0078](adr/0078-certificate-revocation-posture.md)); the proxy branch additionally wants `proxy_intra_service_auth` and `proxy_tls_min_version` on a PHI instance at the shipped enforcement. The browser console refuses an unprotected off-loopback bind outright. |
| **Inbound MLLP / TCP listeners** | operator-defined (samples use e.g. `2575`, `2600`) | Open to sending systems via firewall. **MLLP-over-TLS is built and opt-in per connection** (WP-13b, `tls = true`, TLS 1.2+ — see [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md)): an inbound presents `tls_cert_file`/`tls_key_file` as its server identity and opts into **mTLS** with `tls_ca_file`; an outbound **verifies the partner's certificate by default** (`tls_verify`, `tls_check_hostname`, both `true`). Plaintext is still the **default**, so a non-loopback MLLP listener must set `tls = true`: an off-loopback cleartext listener is **refused at wiring time** with a `WiringError` before the engine starts, and `serve --allow-insecure-bind` is itself clamped — a PHI instance at the shipped enforcement refuses even with the flag. A cleartext MLLP **egress** off loopback is likewise **refused** whenever `[security].enforcement = enforce` (the default) — **regardless of data class**, since [ADR 0153](adr/0153-collapse-the-posture-gradient-no-data-label-may-allow-a-cleartext-hop.md) removed the synthetic-instance exemption. The escapes are an attested hop, `cleartext_accepted = true` (warn + audit), or `enforcement = warn`. |
| **Outbound** | as configured | Reachability to downstream partners and, for server DBs, to the database host. |
| Installer egress | HTTPS | Outbound access for the service installer to fetch the pinned NSSM binary (or pre-stage it). |

### How throughput is bounded (read this first)

A single engine process runs **all** message work — decode → peek → route → transform → re-encode —
on **one CPU core** (one asyncio event loop; the GIL prevents pure-Python parallelism across threads).
So per-process throughput is governed, in order, by:

1. **Transform cost per message** — usually the binding constraint. The project's own
   [throughput research](archive/throughput/THROUGHPUT-IMPROVEMENTS.md) cites a comparable vendor
   benchmark where real transformation cut pass-through throughput by ~60% (≈1000 msg/s → ≈400 msg/s).
   A light/pass-through feed sits near the top of a tier; a heavy transform sits near the bottom.
2. **Durable-write cost** — every stage handoff (ingress → routed → outbound → delivered) is a
   committed transaction. In-process **SQLite is fastest per write**; a **server DB is slower per
   single write** (network + MVCC) but is the concurrency substrate (next point).

**To exceed one core today**, scale **intra-node** on a server DB: many connections / lanes / delivery
workers draining **one shared server database** (PostgreSQL or SQL Server) concurrently via
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` + row leases. Throughput scales with workers until the **database's
commit capacity** is the wall. (SQLite is single-writer and does **not** scale this way — it is the
single-process / single-node store.) Engine HA is **single-leader active-passive** — the graph runs on
the leader only. A **multi-process, sharded-by-inbound** scale-out (multiple engines, each owning a
disjoint set of inbounds) **is built** — `messagefoundry supervise`
([ADR 0037](adr/0037-multi-process-sharding-l3.md)); with more than one shard it **requires a server
DB** so all shards share **one unified store** ([ADR 0063](adr/0063-no-split-store-unified-store-for-sharding.md)),
and the N-concurrently-active reliability runtime is built by
[ADR 0073](adr/0073-ownership-scoped-recovery-single-consumer-lanes.md): startup/DR crash recovery is
**ownership-scoped** (a restarting shard re-pends only its own lanes' in-flight rows, never a live
sibling's) and each outbound lane has a **single delivery consumer** (deterministic rendezvous
ownership, so per-lane FIFO holds across shards). Sharding and `[cluster]` active-passive are
mutually exclusive (refused at startup); a shard-set change requires a coordinated fleet restart
(reload refuses it). **Certification status:** the mechanism is built and invariant-tested, but
N-active on one store is not yet certified as a supported production topology — that flips only after
the clean 4-engine no-loss bench (sustained, zero loss, per-lane FIFO). Until then, treat
multi-engine deployments as **active-passive** (one active writer per store) for production sizing.

> **Connection-count guidance.** On a server-DB store, the pre-ADR-0066 `per_lane` topology ran a
> claim loop per connection per stage against the shared queue; at very high connection counts the
> *store's* claim path saturated on lock contention **independent of message volume** (measured:
> ~1,500 connections pinned an 8-vCPU store box at idle). The **default `pooled` claim mode**
> ([ADR 0066](adr/0066-pooled-stage-claimers.md), the default since #744) **collapses that claim
> storm** — a handful of shared per-stage claimers (`StageDispatcher`) replace the ~1,500 loops — so at
> high connection counts, keep the default `pooled`. If you pin `[pipeline].claim_mode = "per_lane"`,
> size deployments to **no more than a few hundred connections per store** and enable
> `[pipeline].per_lane_wake` so idle connections cost the store ~nothing. Two caveats of running at the
> scale pooled unlocks — **exactly-once degrades under load** (no inbound de-duplication, so receivers
> must be idempotent) and the flip evidence is **single-node** (failover duplicate/ordering paths
> unmeasured; the T17 infra-fault limitation is tracked by ADR 0070) — are documented in the
> "Pipeline claim mode" section of [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md).

### Tiers

| Tier | Peak sustained ingress | Indicative daily volume | Deployment shape | Store | Suggested hardware (engine host) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pilot / light** | up to ~30 msg/s | up to ~1.0 M/day | 1 process, single node | SQLite | 2 cores / 4 GB |
| **Standard single-node** | ~30–70 msg/s | ~1.0–2.2 M/day | 1 process, single node | SQLite, or PostgreSQL / SQL Server | 4 cores / 8 GB |
| **High single-node** | ~70–100 msg/s | ~2.2–3.2 M/day | 1 process, tuned (lean transforms; low fan-out; the default `pooled` claim mode; finite-retry on hot lanes), many connections / lanes draining concurrently via `SKIP LOCKED` | Server DB on its **own** host (PostgreSQL / SQL Server) | 4–8 cores / 16 GB + a DB host sized to the commit load |
| **Multi-process (engine shards)** | ~165 msg/s measured at 4 engine shards (**per-shard SQLite**); beyond that ≈ *N* × your measured single-shard rate × 0.85 | ~5.3 M/day at that measured rate | *N* `messagefoundry supervise` engine-shard processes, partitioned by inbound connection — **not yet certified as a production topology** (see above) | **PostgreSQL / SQL Server** — required above one shard, so all engine shards share **one unified store** | 8+ cores / 32 GB + a dedicated DB host sized to the commit load |

**Reading the tiers — and checking the arithmetic**

Every peak figure in the table is a **measured** rate with a named source run — the only extrapolation is
the per-shard multiplier on the last row. Where a tier's *hardware* row was never itself measured, its
bullet says so rather than interpolating. Here is the derivation, so you can check it.

- **Units.** *Peak sustained ingress* is **messages received per second**, at the **low fan-out (~1–2
  destinations per received message)** of every anchor run below. A high-fan-out hub commits and delivers
  several copies per received message and sustains a **much lower** ingress rate — see the last bullet.
- **Daily = peak × 86,400 ÷ 2.7**, i.e. `peak × ~32,000` — **not** `peak × 86,400`. Healthcare feeds are
  bursty: in the production ADT feeds profiled in [THROUGHPUT.md](THROUGHPUT.md) §6 the **busiest hour runs
  ~2.7× the all-day average**, and you must size to the peak hour, so a peak-rate figure carries only
  `86,400 / 2.7` seconds' worth of messages a day. That is the duty cycle assumed in the *indicative daily
  volume* column, and it is the same arithmetic THROUGHPUT.md §6 works through (60 msg/s → ~1.9 M/day, not
  ~5.2 M). Substitute your own peak-hour ÷ daily-average ratio once you have measured one.
- **Pilot / light — ~30 msg/s** is the **lowest** sustainable rate measured across the three backends on
  the published reference config: **~30 msg/s on SQL Server**, conformance-clean, fan-out 2, on a 4-vCPU
  runner with the database co-located ([TUNING-BASELINE.md](benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md) §Results). **No
  2-core point has ever been measured**, so this tier deliberately takes the floor of the measured band
  rather than interpolating a figure for its own hardware row. `30 × 32,000 ≈ 0.96 M/day`.
- **Standard single-node — ~30–70 msg/s** is that same reference config's full measured band: **~30
  (SQL Server) · ~50 (PostgreSQL) · ≥ 70 (SQLite, still not saturated at the top rate step)**. It brackets
  the **~60 msg/s end-to-end** ceiling measured for one strictly-ordered interface against an
  *instant-acknowledging* partner, versus **~193 msg/s per engine at intake** (ACK-on-receipt,
  engine-CPU-bound; ~383 msg/s measured at two engines) — i.e. **~16 ms** for the whole serial
  per-message budget, most of which is store round-trips rather than engine time
  ([THROUGHPUT.md](THROUGHPUT.md) §8). `30–70 × 32,000 ≈ 0.96–2.24 M/day`. The
  ~1000 msg/s pass-through figure quoted above is a **vendor's** self-benchmark, not a MEFOR measurement.
- **High single-node — ~70–100 msg/s** is the highest rate ever measured from **one engine process**:
  **~97 msg/s max sustainable** (zero-loss, bounded backlog) and **~107 msg/s** as a burst that still
  drained — one process, **1,500 inbound connections**, the default `pooled` claim mode, SQL Server 2022 on
  its own box, fan-out 1 ([`benchmarks/adr0066-pooled-claimer-744.md`](benchmarks/adr0066-pooled-claimer-744.md)
  §2). Engine CPU sat at ~2 cores throughout and a 3× larger store pool did not move the ceiling, so this
  is the **ceiling of a single engine process** — the tier above it is not "more concurrency", it is **more
  processes**. `70–100 × 32,000 ≈ 2.24–3.2 M/day`.
- **Multi-process (engine shards) — ~165 msg/s at 4 shards.** Measured 1 → 2 → 4 engine shards at **~50 →
  88.7 → 165.5 msg/s** aggregate, i.e. ~linear scaling at an efficiency **η ≈ 0.85** per added shard
  ([TUNING-BASELINE.md](benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md) §Multi-process sharding scale-out).
  `165.5 × 32,000 ≈ 5.3 M/day`. **Two limits travel with this row.** That run used **per-shard SQLite on a
  consumer 8-core test box**, so the portable result is the **speedup shape**, not the absolute rate:
  multiply η by *your* measured single-shard rate. And a production multi-shard deployment must share
  **one unified server-DB store** ([ADR 0063](adr/0063-no-split-store-unified-store-for-sharding.md)) — a
  shape that run never exercised, and one measured **worse** (next bullet).
- **Where the tiers stop, and why.** Fan-out and the shared store — not the tier label — set the real
  number. On **one shared SQL Server store at a fan-out of 8**, the definitive 900-second soak of a 4-shard
  fleet sustained **10 msg/s of ingress** (80 deliveries/s, 90 total message events/s), and a fixed light
  load scaled cleanly only to **4 engine shards** — N = 8 and N = 16 collapsed
  ([`benchmarks/THROUGHPUT-STATUS-2026-07-10.md`](benchmarks/THROUGHPUT-STATUS-2026-07-10.md) §3). Nor do
  per-interface ceilings **add**: a measured 16-lane run delivered **87/s in aggregate — 5.44/s per lane** —
  where summing the per-lane ceilings would have predicted ~960/s, an **~11× over-report**
  ([THROUGHPUT.md](THROUGHPUT.md) §7). Always take `min(measured concurrent aggregate, Σ per-interface)`,
  and measure a high-fan-out hub rather than sizing it off the low-fan-out rows above.
  **~165 msg/s of ingress is the highest end-to-end rate in the sizing tiers above**, and no figure in
  this document may be quoted as more. That bound is about *these* tiers, which are per-interface
  ingress rates on the hardware described here — it is not a statement about the engine's aggregate
  ceiling. A separate four-shard measurement against a shared SQL Server store reached ~603 total
  message events per second (counting messages in **and** out); see the Throughput & Capacity
  document. The two are different units on different hardware and should never be compared directly.
- **Do not size on a future per-core lever.** Group-commit and the wider "reduce committed transactions per
  event" lever are **closed, not pending** — group-commit was withdrawn
  ([ADR 0055](adr/0055-group-commit-durable-write.md)) and the pre-registered measurement returned ABANDON
  at an elasticity of −0.115
  ([ADR 0107](adr/0107-phase-4-is-closed-transaction-reduction-is-a-measured-dead-end.md)).

> **Single-stream server-DB caveat.** Because each staged handoff is a committed round-trip, a single
> delivery worker against a server DB drains far slower than in-process SQLite (the published baseline
> measures **~30 msg/s sustainable on SQL Server** vs **≥ 70 on SQLite** for one stream —
> [TUNING-BASELINE.md](benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md) §Results). High volume on a server DB comes from
> **concurrency** — many connections / lanes / processes draining in parallel — not single-stream speed.
> Size the DB host for that concurrent commit load.

### Capacity notes

- Validate with the load harness ([LOAD-TESTING.md](LOAD-TESTING.md)): run the `smoke` →
  `fanout-baseline` → `soak` ramp, exercise the `cheap` / `edit` / `slow` transform modes to find your
  per-core transform ceiling, and compare SQLite vs a server DB on identical traffic. Treat the
  **zero-loss reconciliation** as the headline gate — throughput is meaningless if messages were lost.
- The embedded store has ~3× write amplification and a single-writer ceiling; move to PostgreSQL or
  SQL Server when that becomes the bottleneck.
- Scale **intra-node** on a server DB (one delivery worker per outbound; many connections / lanes
  draining concurrently via `SKIP LOCKED`; keep retry policies finite where head-of-line blocking on a
  shared FIFO lane would otherwise stall a lane). A multi-process **engine-shard** scale-out beyond one
  engine **is built** (`messagefoundry supervise` — [ADR 0037](adr/0037-multi-process-sharding-l3.md),
  [ADR 0063](adr/0063-no-split-store-unified-store-for-sharding.md),
  [ADR 0073](adr/0073-ownership-scoped-recovery-single-consumer-lanes.md)); it needs a server DB so all
  shards share one unified store, and it is **not yet certified as a production topology** — see
  [Sizing by message volume](#sizing-by-message-volume). Engine **HA** is **active-passive failover**
  (opt-in leader/standby cluster on shared PostgreSQL — see [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md)); delegate
  **DB-tier** HA to the database + a load-balancer VIP.
