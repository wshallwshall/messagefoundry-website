# System Requirements & Sizing

These are the minimum and recommended requirements for running the MessageFoundry engine, its message store, and the administration clients. The engine is a headless Python/asyncio service; the console is a separate desktop application.

> **On the throughput figures.** MessageFoundry does not publish a validated, guaranteed per-node throughput baseline. The sizing tiers in [Sizing by message volume](#sizing-by-message-volume) are **engineering estimates** derived from the architecture and from synthetic load-test profiles — they are starting points, not guarantees. Always establish your own baseline on production-like hardware before go-live (see [Capacity notes](#capacity-notes)).

## Hardware

| | Minimum (lab / low-volume pilot) | Recommended (single-node production) |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 4+ cores (transform throughput is per-core; one worker set per connection) |
| **Memory** | 4 GB | 8–16 GB |
| **Disk** | 10 GB free, any disk | **SSD**, 50+ GB or sized to your retention window, on a low-latency local volume |
| **Store volume** | — | Put the message store on a fast local disk (not a network share). Budget for **store + WAL growth**: the staged pipeline writes roughly 3× per message on the embedded store. |

> The engine and store may share a host for a low-volume pilot. For production, run a **server database** (PostgreSQL or SQL Server) on its own host, sized by your DBA, and keep the engine host dedicated. For volume beyond one CPU core, see [Sizing by message volume](#sizing-by-message-volume).

## Operating systems

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| **Windows Server 2022 / 2025** | Primary supported and serviced platform (Windows-service deployment) |
| Windows Server 2019 | Supported |
| Windows 10 / 11 | Supported (development, pilot, console host) |
| **Linux** (modern x86-64 distributions) | Engine supported (cross-platform Python); no bundled service installer — run under systemd yourself |
| macOS | Development / console use only |

## Runtime

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Python** | **3.11 or later**, 64-bit (3.11, 3.12, 3.13 supported; 3.11 and 3.13 are CI-validated) |
| Service manager (Windows) | A Windows service wrapper, auto-provisioned and SHA-256-pinned by the installer, or pre-staged. Requires administrator / elevation to register the service. |
| C compiler | Not required for the default install (runtime dependencies ship as wheels) |

## Databases (message store)

| Database | Status | Driver / prerequisite |
|---|---|---|
| **SQLite (WAL)** | Default, bundled — single-node | None (`aiosqlite`, in-process) |
| **PostgreSQL 13+** | Production | `messagefoundry[postgres]` extra (`asyncpg`, pure-Python — no OS dependency) |
| **Microsoft SQL Server 2019 / 2022** | Production | `messagefoundry[sqlserver]` extra (`aioodbc`) **plus the OS-level Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server**. Read-Committed Snapshot Isolation (RCSI) recommended. |
| MySQL / Oracle | Not supported | — |

> The embedded SQLite store needs no setup and suits pilots and single-node deployments. A **server database is greenfield-only** — there is no in-place migration from a populated SQLite store; drain and cut over. The database tier owns its own backup, HA, and (SQL Server) TDE / purge maintenance. A server database is also the **concurrency / scale substrate** — see below.

## Administration clients

| Client | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Desktop console** | PySide6 (Qt) desktop application — install with the `console` extra. Runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS as a separate process; connects to the engine over the HTTP/WebSocket API. **Not browser-based.** |
| **VS Code extension** | Visual Studio Code (current stable) — route wizard, validate-on-save, test bench, stage → promote. |
| Web browser | Not required to operate the engine (no web admin UI; the API is HTTP/JSON for tooling). |

## Network & ports

| Purpose | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine API** (HTTP + WebSocket) | `127.0.0.1:8765` | **Loopback by default**, authentication required. To reach the API from another host, front it with a **TLS-terminating reverse proxy** or tunnel — exposing the listener off loopback should always be done over TLS. |
| **Inbound MLLP / TCP listeners** | operator-defined (samples use e.g. `2575`, `2600`) | Open to sending systems via firewall. Keep MLLP on a **trusted network segment**. |
| **Outbound** | as configured | Reachability to downstream partners and, for server databases, to the database host. |
| Installer egress | HTTPS | Outbound access for the service installer to fetch the pinned service-wrapper binary (or pre-stage it). |

> **Interface authentication.** Beyond network-segment controls, interfaces can authenticate with **mutual TLS (mTLS)**, **OAuth 2.0 client-credentials**, and **SMART-on-FHIR Backend Services**. Administrative access uses required multi-factor authentication for local accounts; enterprise / Active Directory users authenticate (and get MFA) through their own identity provider via SSO federation.

## Sizing by message volume

> **Engineering estimate — not a validated benchmark.** These tiers project the architecture's behavior; they are not committed numbers. Throughput depends heavily on **transform cost per message** (the dominant factor), message size, fan-out, and strict-validation use. **Measure your own feeds** with the load harness before committing (see [Capacity notes](#capacity-notes)).

### How throughput is bounded (read this first)

A single engine process runs **all** message work — decode → peek → route → transform → re-encode — on **one CPU core** (one asyncio event loop; the GIL prevents pure-Python parallelism across threads). So per-process throughput is governed, in order, by:

1. **Transform cost per message** — usually the binding constraint. As an illustrative estimate, a comparable vendor benchmark shows real transformation cutting pass-through throughput by roughly 60% (≈1000 msg/s → ≈400 msg/s). A light / pass-through feed sits near the top of a tier; a heavy transform sits near the bottom.
2. **Durable-write cost** — every stage handoff (ingress → routed → outbound → delivered) is a committed transaction. In-process **SQLite is fastest per write**; a **server database is slower per single write** (network + MVCC) but is the concurrency substrate (next point).

**To exceed one core**, scale **intra-node** on a server database: many connections / lanes / delivery workers draining **one shared server database** (PostgreSQL or SQL Server) concurrently via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` plus row leases. Throughput scales with workers until the **database's commit capacity** is the wall. (SQLite is single-writer and does **not** scale this way — it is the single-process / single-node store.) Engine HA is **single-leader active-passive** — the graph runs on the leader only. A **multi-process, sharded-by-inbound** scale-out (multiple engines, each owning a disjoint set of inbounds, on the shared database) is a **future direction, not a current capability**.

### Tiers

| Tier | Peak sustained (est.) | Indicative daily volume | Deployment shape | Store | Suggested hardware (engine host) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pilot / light** | up to ~50 msg/s | up to ~1–4 M/day | 1 process, single node | SQLite | 2 cores / 4 GB |
| **Standard single-node** | ~50–200 msg/s | ~4–15 M/day | 1 process, single node | SQLite, or PostgreSQL / SQL Server | 4 cores / 8 GB |
| **High single-node** | ~200–500 msg/s | ~15–40 M/day | 1 process, tuned (lean transforms; finite-retry on hot lanes) | Server database recommended (PostgreSQL / SQL Server) | 4–8 cores / 16 GB |
| **High single-node, concurrent** | up to ~500 – low-thousands msg/s | up to ~40 M+/day | 1 process, many connections / lanes draining concurrently via `SKIP LOCKED` | **PostgreSQL / SQL Server** (required — not SQLite) | 8+ cores / 32 GB + a dedicated database host sized to the commit load |

**Reading the tiers**

- *Peak sustained* is a **per-second** capacity estimate. Healthcare feeds are bursty; real **average** rate (and therefore daily volume) is typically a fraction of peak, so the *indicative daily volume* columns assume a realistic duty cycle, not `peak × 86,400`.
- The **single-stream / single-core ceiling** is roughly the "High single-node" row — a few hundred msg/s with real transforms, approaching ~1000 msg/s only for light / pass-through work. Past that on one feed you are over one core's budget.
- The **estimated maximum as currently architected** is the **"High single-node, concurrent"** row: one engine process, many connections / lanes draining the shared server database concurrently via `SKIP LOCKED`, bounded by the database's commit ceiling. There is no fixed published cap — on a well-provisioned box with a tuned server database this lands in the **low thousands of msg/s**, beyond which you are **database-bound** and scale the database tier. (A multi-process, sharded-by-inbound scale-out beyond one engine is a **future direction**.) Group-commit and a lazy MSH-only routing peek are identified levers to raise the per-core ceiling.

> **Single-stream server-DB caveat.** Because each staged handoff is a committed round-trip, a single delivery worker against a *remote* server database drains far slower than in-process SQLite (a SQL Server CI smoke profile observes roughly 30 deliveries/s for one stream). High volume on a server database comes from **concurrency** — many connections / lanes / processes draining in parallel — not single-stream speed. Size the database host for that concurrent commit load.

### Capacity notes

- Validate with the load harness: run a `smoke` → `fanout-baseline` → `soak` ramp, exercise the `cheap` / `edit` / `slow` transform modes to find your per-core transform ceiling, and compare SQLite vs a server database on identical traffic. Treat the **zero-loss reconciliation** as the headline gate — throughput is meaningless if messages were lost.
- The embedded store has roughly 3× write amplification and a single-writer ceiling; move to PostgreSQL or SQL Server when that becomes the bottleneck.
- Scale **intra-node** on a server database (one delivery worker per outbound; many connections / lanes draining concurrently via `SKIP LOCKED`; keep retry policies finite where head-of-line blocking on a shared FIFO lane would otherwise stall a lane). A multi-process scale-out beyond one engine is a **future direction**. Engine **HA** is **active-passive failover** (opt-in leader / standby cluster on shared PostgreSQL — see [CLUSTERING.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CLUSTERING.md)); delegate **database-tier** HA to the database plus a load-balancer VIP.
