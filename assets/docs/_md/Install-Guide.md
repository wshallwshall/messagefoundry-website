# Installing MessageFoundry — the engine + your configuration repository

This guide explains how an organization installs **MessageFoundry (MEFOR)** and stands up the
**private git repository** that holds its integration configuration. It is the practical companion to
[ADR 0017](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/adr/0017-consumer-deployment-model.md) (the consumer deployment model).

## 1. The model in one paragraph

MessageFoundry ships as a **read-only, version-pinned engine** (a Python wheel) that your team installs
but **never edits**. All of *your* work — the Connections, Routers, and Handlers that define your
interfaces — lives in a **separate, private git repository your organization owns**: your *config repo*.
One config repo drives **all** of your engine instances (Test and Production at minimum; optionally
POC/Staging), with each instance selecting its environment and security posture at runtime. The
practical consequence: integration developers author and review interface logic in a normal git/PR
workflow, and the engine underneath them is a fixed, auditable dependency they cannot quietly modify.

Three ownership tiers — keeping them separate is the whole design:

| Tier | What it is | Who owns / edits it |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine** | The installed `messagefoundry` wheel (pinned version) | The MessageFoundry project — you install it, never edit it |
| **Config repo** | Your private git repo: Connection/Router/Handler `.py`, code sets, `environments/<env>.toml`, fixtures | Your integration developers — authored via pull requests |
| **Per-instance settings** | `messagefoundry.toml` + `MEFOR_*` environment variables + secrets | Your operators, per deployed instance — **never** committed to the repo |

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** on each engine host (the engine targets 3.11+).
- **git**, plus a **private git host** — GitHub (private repo), GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, or a
  self-hosted server. Nothing about MessageFoundry requires a public repo; your config repo is yours.
- A source for the engine wheel: **public PyPI** is the distribution channel
  (`pip install messagefoundry`); an **internal package index** (Artifactory, Azure Artifacts, a
  private PyPI) can mirror the signed wheel for air-gapped or offline sites.
- Administrator/elevation on the host if you will install the engine as a Windows service (see
  [SERVICE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SERVICE.md)).

---

## 3. Step 1 — Install the engine (a pinned, read-only dependency)

On each host, create a virtual environment and install the engine at a **pinned version**:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1                 # Linux/macOS: . .venv/bin/activate
pip install "messagefoundry==0.2.0rc1"          # pin the exact version (core runtime only)
```

> ⚠️ **Early access.** `0.2.0rc1` is an **Early Access** release on public PyPI — feature-complete and
> test-validated, but the external review + pen test that gate a security-certified **v1.0** land after
> launch. The exact-pin command above (`==0.2.0rc1`) resolves today; the earlier `0.2.0rc1` pre-release also
> remains installable (`pip install messagefoundry==0.2.0rc1`). You can equally install from the engine's
> **GitHub Release assets** or your organization's **private index**.

Add extras only for what a host actually runs — `messagefoundry[postgres]` (PostgreSQL store),
`messagefoundry[sqlserver]` (SQL Server store + the DATABASE connectors, needs OS-level ODBC Driver 18),
`messagefoundry[console]` (desktop admin console), `messagefoundry[sftp]` (SFTP connectors).

Key properties this install model gives you:

- **Non-editable.** A normal `pip install` lands the engine in `site-packages` as a regular installed
  package — not an editable checkout. Developers import its public surface; they do not have the engine
  source tree in front of them to change.
- **Pinned + reproducible.** The exact version is recorded in your config repo's `requirements.txt`
  (Step 2). An engine upgrade is a deliberate, reviewable one-line bump — never an accident. For a fully
  reproducible deploy, extend that into a hash-locked requirements file and install with
  `--require-hashes`.

### Verify the release before you install (supply-chain integrity)

MessageFoundry ships **one signed wheel to many PHI-bearing instances**, so verify the artifact's
provenance *before* installing it — pinning a version (or a hash) proves you got a *fixed* file, not that
it's the one MessageFoundry built. Every release carries **SLSA build provenance** (binding the wheel's
SHA-256 → the source commit → the GitHub Actions builder) and a **Sigstore signature**. Check both with
the **GitHub CLI** (`gh` ≥ 2.49), and optionally `sigstore` (`pip install sigstore`); install **only** the
file that passes.

```powershell
$V = "0.2.0rc1"   # the exact version you intend to install

# Download the wheel + its Sigstore bundle from that release's assets
gh release download "v$V" --repo MEFORORG/MessageFoundry `
  --pattern "messagefoundry-$V-*.whl" --pattern "messagefoundry-$V-*.whl.sigstore*"

# Verify SLSA build provenance:  artifact -> source commit -> builder workflow
gh attestation verify "messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl" --repo MEFORORG/MessageFoundry

# (defense in depth) Verify the Sigstore signature pins the release workflow identity
python -m sigstore verify identity "messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl" `
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v$V" `
  --cert-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

# Only if BOTH pass, install the exact file you verified
pip install ".\messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl"
```

The same attestation also covers the **public PyPI** copy of the wheel (it is byte-identical to the
GitHub-built artifact, so the digest matches), so you can download-verify-then-install from the index:

```powershell
$V = "0.2.0rc1"
pip download "messagefoundry==$V" --no-deps -d .\verify
gh attestation verify (Get-ChildItem ".\verify\messagefoundry-$V-*.whl").FullName --repo MEFORORG/MessageFoundry
pip install --no-index --find-links .\verify "messagefoundry==$V"
```

A registry/mirror substitution or a relabelled file **fails** the check. For a fully pinned deploy, pair
this with `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock` (the identity check above is the part
`--require-hashes` cannot give you — it proves bytes-match-lockfile, not who built them). The
`-rc`-tagged pre-releases publish to production PyPI too; the `--cert-identity` ref above must match the
tag you are installing (e.g. `refs/tags/v0.2.0rc1`).

---

## 4. Step 2 — Create your config repo with the scaffolder

The engine ships an `init` command that lays down a complete, **`check`-green-from-the-first-commit**
config repo skeleton:

```powershell
messagefoundry init ./my-config-repo
cd my-config-repo
```

It writes:

```
my-config-repo/
├─ config/IB_EXAMPLE_ADT.py        # a runnable starter feed (receive ADT over MLLP → archive to file)
├─ environments/dev.toml           # non-secret per-environment values for env("…") lookups
├─ environments/prod.toml
├─ messages/sets/example_adt.hl7   # a synthetic fixture (NO real PHI) that gates `check`
├─ messagefoundry.toml             # THIS instance's settings (environment + posture + store + API + egress)
├─ requirements.txt                # pins the engine:  messagefoundry==0.2.0rc1
├─ .github/workflows/check.yml     # CI: install the pinned engine + run `messagefoundry check` on every PR
├─ .vscode/settings.json           # points the VS Code extension at config/ + messages/
├─ .gitignore  .gitattributes      # excludes stores, secrets, captures, venvs, caches
└─ README.md
```

Validate it immediately:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
messagefoundry check --config config --messages messages/sets
```

`check` runs validate + dry-run against the synthetic fixture — the same gate your CI runs on every pull
request. From here, your developers replace the starter feed with real Connections/Routers/Handlers,
authored against the engine's public surface (`inbound` / `outbound` / `@router` / `@handler` / `Send` /
`Message` / `MLLP` / `File` / `env` / `code_set` …). They never touch engine code to do it.

---

## 5. Step 3 — Make it a *private* git repo

The scaffolded directory is ready to become your private repo:

```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial MessageFoundry config (scaffolded)"
# then point it at your private host, e.g.:
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-org/mefor-config.git   # a PRIVATE repo
git push -u origin main
```

What makes this private and safe:

- **Repo visibility.** Create the remote as **Private** on whatever host you standardize on. The engine
  imposes no requirement here — your config repo is yours, access-controlled by your git host's
  permissions (teams, SSO, branch protection).
- **No secrets, ever.** The scaffolded `.gitignore` already excludes `*.db`, `.env`, captures, and build
  cruft. **Secrets — DB passwords, keys, credentials — are injected at runtime via `MEFOR_*` environment
  variables**, never written to the repo. The versioned `environments/<env>.toml` files hold only
  **non-secret** endpoints (hostnames, ports), which is exactly what you want diffable and reviewable.
- **No PHI in the repo.** Test fixtures are **synthetic only**. Real message bodies live in the engine's
  secured store at runtime, not in git.
- **CI as the gate.** The included `check.yml` installs the pinned engine and runs `messagefoundry check`
  on every PR. Turn on **branch protection** on `main` so changes land only through reviewed,
  check-passing pull requests — interface logic gets the same rigor as application code.
- **Branch → PR → review → merge** is the entire authoring workflow. There is no separate "engine
  change" path for developers, because there is no engine to change.

---

## 6. Step 4 — Configure each instance (settings + posture + secrets)

Each deployed instance gets its own `messagefoundry.toml` (the scaffolder generates a starting one) plus
its `MEFOR_*` environment. Two things every instance must state:

- **`[ai].environment`** — a free-form name (`test`, `prod`, `poc`, …) that selects
  `environments/<name>.toml`.
- **Security posture, explicit and decoupled from the name:** `[ai].data_class` (`synthetic` | `phi` —
  does this instance carry *real* PHI?) and `[ai].production` (is this a production tier?). Built-in names
  `dev`/`staging`/`prod` derive a sensible default posture; **any custom name must state posture
  explicitly** — the engine fails closed rather than guess.

Secrets and host-specific overrides come from the environment, e.g. `MEFOR_VALUE_<KEY>` for values used
by `env("…")` in the graph, and `MEFOR_<SECTION>_<KEY>` for service settings. Precedence is **CLI flag >
`MEFOR_*` env > `messagefoundry.toml` > built-in default**. Full reference:
[CONFIGURATION.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

---

## 7. Step 5 — Run / deploy an instance

```powershell
messagefoundry serve --config config --env test --project-root C:\srv\mefor\my-config-repo
```

- **`--project-root`** (or `[environments].base_dir` in `messagefoundry.toml`) anchors
  `environments/<env>.toml` resolution to the repo root, so values resolve **regardless of the working
  directory**. This matters when the engine runs as a **Windows service under NSSM**, where the launch
  directory isn't your repo. (Omit it only when you always launch from the repo root.)
- The engine **binds `127.0.0.1` by default** and **requires authentication**. To expose a channel
  off-loopback, configure **native TLS** (API: `[api].tls_cert_file`/`tls_key_file` or a trusted upstream
  terminator; MLLP inbound: per-connection `tls = true`) — a non-loopback bind without TLS is **refused at
  startup**. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
- For production, run the engine as a **Windows service via NSSM** — see [SERVICE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SERVICE.md).

### Launching the admin console (no command line)

Operators monitor and run an instance from the **PySide6 admin console** — a separate desktop app that
talks to the engine over its localhost API. Install the console extra, then drop a Desktop / Start-Menu
shortcut so it opens with a double-click, no terminal:

```powershell
pip install "messagefoundry[console]==0.2.0rc1"     # PySide6 + keyring, into the same venv
.\scripts\console\install-console-shortcut.ps1   # per-user icon (add -AllUsers, elevated, for machine-wide)
```

The shortcut launches `messagefoundry-console.exe` — a **windowed** launcher (no flashing console
window) carrying the MessageFoundry badge. Double-click it: the console connects to the engine
(`http://127.0.0.1:8765` by default — typically the boot-start [service](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SERVICE.md)) and prompts for
sign-in, so nothing else is needed for the local case. Point it at a different engine with
`-Url https://engine.internal:8765` (off-loopback requires TLS), and remove the icons with
`uninstall-console-shortcut.ps1`. (A shell still works too: `messagefoundry-console` or
`python -m messagefoundry.console`.)

---

## 8. Multiple instances from one repo (Test, Production, POC…)

This is the payoff of the model: **the same reviewed commit of your config repo is deployed to every
instance.** You do **not** maintain per-environment branches. Each host differs only in its
`messagefoundry.toml` (environment name + posture) and its `MEFOR_*` environment:

```
                ┌────────────────────────────────┐
                │  Your private config repo (git) │   one commit, reviewed via PR
                └───────────────┬────────────────┘
            same commit ────────┼─────────────────────
        ┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐
        │  TEST host    │  │  PROD host    │  │  POC host     │
        │ env=test      │  │ env=prod      │  │ env=poc       │
        │ data_class=…  │  │ data_class=phi│  │ production=f  │
        │ MEFOR_* (test)│  │ MEFOR_* (prod)│  │ MEFOR_* (poc) │
        └───────────────┘  └───────────────┘  └───────────────┘
       engine 0.2.0rc1 wheel  engine 0.2.0rc1 wheel  engine 0.2.0rc1 wheel  (pinned, identical)
```

Promotion = merge to `main` → deploy that commit everywhere. A Test instance resolves
`environments/test.toml`; Prod resolves `environments/prod.toml`; a Test instance can never accidentally
read Prod values. (Each instance is otherwise an independent engine with its own store; for multi-node
high availability of a single instance, see [CLUSTERING.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CLUSTERING.md).)

---

## 9. Why integration developers can't modify the engine

Three layers reinforce the boundary:

1. **Packaging.** The engine is an installed, **non-editable** wheel. Developers work exclusively in the
   config repo; the engine source isn't in their working tree.
2. **Version pinning.** `requirements.txt` pins an exact engine version; any change to it is a visible,
   reviewable PR — and CI re-runs `check` against the new version before it can merge.
3. **(Optional) OS enforcement.** Operators can make the venv's `site-packages` read-only (Windows ACL)
   so the installed engine can't be edited in place even by mistake.

There is simply no developer workflow that routes through engine source — by construction.

---

## 10. Upgrading the engine

1. Bump the pin in `requirements.txt` (e.g. `messagefoundry==0.2.0rc1`) on a branch.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `messagefoundry check` locally; open a PR — CI re-validates
   your whole config against the new engine.
3. Merge, and roll the new commit to Test first, then Production. Because everything is pinned and your
   config is gated by `check`, upgrades are deliberate and reversible (pin back). The full
   upgrade/rollback runbook is in [EARLY-ADOPTER-GUIDE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/EARLY-ADOPTER-GUIDE.md) §13.

### Bottom line
Install the pinned engine into a venv; run `messagefoundry init` to scaffold a private config repo; push
it to your private git host with branch protection + the included CI check; deploy as many instances as
you need from that one repo, each with its own environment name, posture, and secrets. Your developers
get a clean, reviewable, code-first authoring experience, and the engine stays a fixed, auditable
dependency they never edit.
