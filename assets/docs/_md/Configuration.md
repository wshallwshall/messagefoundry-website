# Service configuration & settings

> **An unimplemented key is accepted *silently*** — every section model is pydantic `extra="ignore"`, so

> flagged where it is documented: the **whole `[engine]` section** (see [`[engine]`](#engine)),
> `[delivery].outbox_workers`/`dead_letter`, `[logging].file`/`max_bytes`/`backups`,
> `[retention].audit_days` (**reserved/keep-forever by design**), `[reference].max_staleness_seconds`,
> `[ai].baa_attested`, and `[update_check].index_url`/`index_allowed_hosts`.

## Principle — two kinds of configuration

MessageFoundry deliberately separates them:

1. **The message graph is code-first.** Connections / Routers / Handlers are authored as Python
   ([config/wiring.py](../messagefoundry/config/wiring.py)) and loaded from `--config`. This never
   becomes a settings file — no YAML, no declarative channel config.
2. **Service/operational settings are deployment config**, not code: where the store lives and its
   credentials, the API bind address, logging, retention, retry defaults, etc. These are what this
   document covers. They're set by whoever *operates* the service (ops/admin), not by the interface
   author, and must keep **secrets out of source control**.

## Mechanism

A single **`messagefoundry.toml`** (TOML — consistent with `pyproject.toml`; **not** YAML, and not
channel config) with one section per group, plus **environment-variable overrides** for secrets, plus
**CLI flags** for the common knobs. Precedence (highest first):

```
CLI flag  >  environment variable  >  messagefoundry.toml  >  built-in default
```

- File location: `./messagefoundry.toml` by default, or `--service-config <path>`.
- **Secrets** (e.g. a DB password) should come from **env** (or a secret reference), never plaintext
  in the file — env wins over the file so a deployment can inject them.
- Env naming: `MEFOR_<SECTION>_<KEY>` (e.g. `MEFOR_STORE_PASSWORD`, `MEFOR_API_PORT`). The parser splits
  the name at the **first** `_` after the prefix and matches that against a known-section list, so five
  built sections have **no env layer** and a `MEFOR_*` var aimed at one is dropped without a warning:
  `[sandbox]`, `[service]`, and the underscored `[cert_monitor]`, `[secret_rotation]`, `[update_check]`.
  Set those in the file.
- Loaded once at startup into a typed `ServiceSettings` (pydantic) model; the engine + store read from
  it. `serve` keeps its existing flags as the CLI layer.

## Settings catalog

### `[store]` — message store / DB
The keys are **implemented in `StoreSettings`**. **All three backends are built and selectable:**
SQLite is the zero-dependency default; **Postgres** and **SQL Server** are production server-DB
backends behind their extras. What each one supports is the
[capability matrix](#per-backend-capability-matrix) below — read it before assuming a feature is
backend-limited.
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backend` | enum | `sqlite` | `sqlite` · `postgres` · `sqlserver` · (later `mysql`/`oracle`) — all three implemented; see the [capability matrix](#per-backend-capability-matrix) |
| `path` | str | `./messagefoundry.db` | SQLite only |
| `synchronous` | enum | `normal` | SQLite: `normal`/`full` |
| `group_commit_window_ms` | float (ms) | `0.0` | **SQLite only** ([ADR 0055](adr/0055-group-commit-durable-write.md)). When `> 0` a dedicated committer coroutine **coalesces** the grouped stage-handoff mutations (`enqueue_ingress`, `route_handoff`, `transform_handoff`, `mark_done`, `complete_with_response`, `dead_letter_now`, `mark_failed`) into **one** durable commit, amortizing the per-commit fsync (a large win under `synchronous = full`, muted under the default `normal`). A member waits up to this window for siblings to join before the batch commits; the claim / reference-snapshot / audit writes stay **standalone** (never grouped — the hash chain must not batch). `0` (the default) = **off**, byte-identical to the inline-commit path. Ignored by the server-DB backends, which coalesce through their connection pool instead. |
| `group_commit_max_batch` | int | `64` | **SQLite only.** Flush threshold for the group-commit committer: once this many members are enrolled in the open batch it commits immediately rather than waiting out the rest of `group_commit_window_ms`, bounding batch size + latency under load. Ignored when group-commit is off (`group_commit_window_ms = 0`). |
| `fifo_claim_batch` | int | `1` | all backends (ADR 0058). Max rows the **INGRESS/ROUTED** FIFO claim takes per commit. `1` = **OFF** (the workers claim one row per commit — byte-identical to before). `> 1` (clamped `1..64`) claims the **contiguous due head-prefix** in one commit and then processes each row in strict FIFO order with its own off-loop route/transform + separate handoff, amortizing the standalone claim commit toward 1/N. A not-due or producer-locked head still blocks the lane (strict per-lane FIFO, #285). The **outbound/delivery** claim is never batched. Opt-in throughput tuning (recommend `8`–`16`); size against worst-case message size, since N decrypted bodies are resident per lane between the claim and the N handoffs. |
| `fifo_claim_fold_reset` | bool | `false` | **SQL Server only** ([ADR 0114](adr/0114-phase-4-claim-path-call-complexity-reduction-driver-interface-redesign-ingress-routed-reset-fold.md) sub-lever C). Folds the pooled claim's session `LOCK_TIMEOUT` reset into the claim batch on the **clean success path at INGRESS/ROUTED** (the write-less commit#2 disappears; the shielded finally-guard still runs on every non-clean exit — 1222, kept≠claimed, cancellation, any error). OUTBOUND/RESPONSE are never folded. `false` = **byte-identical** shipped batch + guard. Flip only after its own ADR 0114 §8 bench gate (AC-14). |
| `fifo_claim_proc` | bool | `false` | **SQL Server only** (ADR 0114 sub-lever A). Executes the pooled claim via the two lane-family versioned procs `dbo.mefor_claim_fifo_heads_cid_v1` / `_dst_v1` (fixed-arity `{CALL}`, one JSON lanes parameter) instead of the ~3 KB ad-hoc batch. Needs database `COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL >= 130` (SQL Server 2016); **fails safe to the batch, loudly**, when the procs are missing, hand-edited (body-hash mismatch), or compat < 130 — never a lane outage. A hardened split-principal deployment must `GRANT EXECUTE` on both procs to the runtime principal (the bootstrap principal owns them). `false` = byte-identical. Flip only after its own §8 gate (AC-14). |
| `fifo_claim_prepared` | bool | `false` | **SQL Server only** (ADR 0114 sub-lever B). Stabilizes the pooled claim's statement text (one JSON lanes parameter) and retains a prepared claim cursor on store-owned dedicated connections (INGRESS/ROUTED; the non-DDL fallback lane to `fifo_claim_proc`). **Logs + no-ops unless `fifo_claim_fold_reset` is on** (without the fold the finally-guard's reset would evict the one-slot prepare cache every call). `false` = byte-identical. Flip only after its own §8 gate (AC-14). |
| `encryption_key` | secret | — | **env only** (`MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`); base64 32-byte **active** key — when set, PHI columns (`raw`/`payload` + `error`/`last_error`/`detail`) are AES-256-GCM-encrypted at rest. Mint one with `messagefoundry gen-key`. Empty = off. See [PHI.md §3](PHI.md#3-encryption-at-rest). |
| `encryption_keys_retired` | secret | — | **env only** (`MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEYS_RETIRED`); comma-separated base64 **decrypt-only** keys kept available during a rotation until `messagefoundry rotate-key` finishes re-encrypting under the active key (ASVS 11.2.2). |
| `encryption_key_file` | path | — | Windows **DPAPI-protected** key file (WP-11d, ASVS 13.3.1) — a path produced by `messagefoundry protect-key`. When `encryption_key` is unset and this is set, the active key is `CryptUnprotectData`'d from this file at store open, so the plaintext key never sits in the service environment. Windows-only, and the **env key takes precedence** when both are present. A **path, not a secret** — it may live in the file. Unset = use `encryption_key` (the cross-platform default). |
| `aad_bind` | bool | `true` | **not a secret** (`MEFOR_STORE_AAD_BIND`); cell binding (ASVS 11.3.3, [ADR 0019](adr/0019-pluggable-keyprovider-hsm-kms-vault.md)). New at-rest AES-256-GCM writes use the cell-bound `mfenc:v2` writer — each value is bound to its `(table, column, row)` cell via GCM Associated Data, so a ciphertext cut-and-pasted into another cell **fails the auth tag** (dead-lettered `CipherError`) instead of silently decrypting. **On by default** (ADR 0148 GIVEN 1: the shipped configuration runs the hardened path). Setting it `false` selects the frozen `mfenc:v1` writer (byte-identical at rest) and is a **loosening** — `security_loosenings()` names it, so the opt-out is never silent. No effect without an `encryption_key` (the identity cipher has nothing to bind). Legacy `v1` rows still decrypt (dual-read); `messagefoundry rotate-key` upgrades them `v1`→`v2`, so the default is safe and reversible on an existing store. |
| `key_provider` | enum | `auto` | selects **how** the active/retired DEK bytes are *sourced* — never how they are used (the cipher, keyring, and `mfenc:v1` format are unchanged; ADR 0019, ASVS 13.3.3). `auto` (default) is the env-then-DPAPI ladder, **byte-identical** to the pre-seam behavior; `env`/`dpapi` pin a single built-in source; `aws_kms`·`azure_kv`·`gcp_kms`·`vault`·`pkcs11` envelope-decrypt a wrapped DEK inside an HSM/KMS/Vault (lazy **optional extras — not built yet**; selecting one **fails closed** at `serve`, never a silent downgrade). Names a *provider*, not key material, so it is **not** a secret. |
| `cipher_provider` | enum | `aesgcm` | selects the at-rest **cipher itself** — distinct from `key_provider`, which only *sources* DEK bytes for the in-process cipher ([ADR 0138](adr/0138-transit-bulk-crypto-provider-dek-out-of-engine-heap-for-asvs-13-3-3-demand-gated.md), ASVS 13.3.3). `aesgcm` (the default) is that in-process AES-256-GCM cipher, byte-identical to today. `vault_transit` performs the bulk encrypt/decrypt **inside** Vault/OpenBao Transit, so the plaintext DEK never enters engine heap; at-rest values then carry the `mfenc:v3:` marker, the local `encryption_key`/`key_provider` go unused (Transit holds the key), and the audit chain is keyed by Transit's `generate_hmac` — computed inside the vault, so no HMAC key enters heap either. Threaded through **all three** backends. Vault address / token / data-key name come from `MEFOR_STORE_VAULT_ADDR`, `MEFOR_STORE_VAULT_TOKEN` and `MEFOR_STORE_TRANSIT_KEY` (optionally `MEFOR_STORE_TRANSIT_AUDIT_KEY`). Names a *provider*, not key material, so it is **not** a secret. Any other value **fails closed** at `open_store` — never a silent downgrade to plaintext. |
| `require_encryption` | bool | `false` | when `true`, `serve` **refuses to start** without an encryption key in **any** environment, even a synthetic one. Off by default. |
| `allow_unencrypted_phi` | | | **→ moved to `[security].allow_unencrypted_phi`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[store]`. |
| `server`, `port` | str/int | — / 1433 | server DBs (required for `sqlserver`) |
| `database` | str | — | server DBs (required for `sqlserver`) |
| `auth` | enum | `sql` | `sql` · `integrated` · `entra` (SQL Server). `integrated` connects `Trusted_Connection=yes` — the **service account's** Windows identity authenticates (no SQL password); the turnkey **gMSA** walkthrough (grant the gMSA a SQL login + run the service under it) is [`DEPLOY-SERVER-DB.md` §1.1](DEPLOY-SERVER-DB.md). |
| `username` | str | — | server DBs (required when `auth = sql`) |
| `password` | secret | — | **env only** (`MEFOR_STORE_PASSWORD`) |
| `require_managed_identity` | bool | `false` | delegated-identity precondition (#203, ASVS 13.2.1/13.3.2): when `true`, `serve` **refuses** (production) / **warns** (non-production) unless the store authenticates via a managed identity — SQL Server `auth = integrated`/`entra`. SQLite is exempt; Postgres cannot satisfy it. Off by default |
| `encrypt`, `trust_server_certificate` | bool | `true`/`false` | TLS to the DB |
| `ssl_root_cert` | path | — | server DBs — pin the DB server's certificate by **file** so a private/self-signed DB CA verifies **without** a machine-wide trust import, on the **secure** posture only (`encrypt = true`, `trust_server_certificate = false`) — it never disables verification. **Postgres:** an asyncpg `SSLContext` CA-bundle (chain + hostname still checked). **SQL Server:** the ODBC Driver **18.1+** `ServerCertificate` keyword (a leaf/exact-cert match; needs driver ≥ 18.1). Rejected for SQLite (no TLS); a missing file fails loud at load. A path, not a secret — may live in the file. See [`DEPLOY-SERVER-DB.md` §5](DEPLOY-SERVER-DB.md). |
| `multi_subnet_failover` | bool | `false` | **SQL Server only** — emit the ODBC `MultiSubnetFailover=Yes` keyword so a client connecting to an Always On Availability Group **listener** reaches the current primary promptly across subnets, instead of serially waiting out each replica subnet's DNS/TCP timeout on failover. A no-op for Postgres/SQLite (they never see the ODBC string). Off by default — only a multi-subnet AOAG needs it. |
| `pool_size` | int | 40 | server DBs — **server-DB only** (no-op on SQLite). The inverted-U optimum (raised from 5; do **not** set higher — over-provisioning is catastrophic, [ADR 0062](adr/0062-default-store-pool-size.md)). **Per engine:** `engines × pool_size` share one `max_connections` — see [`DEPLOY-SERVER-DB.md`](DEPLOY-SERVER-DB.md) §3 |
| `connect_timeout`, `command_timeout` | int (s) | 15 / 30 | server DBs |
| `warm_pool` | bool | `true` | server DBs — pre-open pooled connections in the background on graph start/promotion so a connection burst (the post-promotion delivery workers, or a cold start) finds them warm instead of paying cold connects (TCP+TLS+login). Best-effort, self-releasing, **no-op on SQLite**. On by default (it touches no commit/correctness seam); set `false` to opt out on a connection-constrained/licensed site. |
| `warm_pool_timeout` | num (s) | 15 | server DBs — upper bound on the background warm-up; on expiry it logs and continues with a partially warm pool. Must be `> 0`. A **clustered** server-DB node also rejects an **explicit** value `>= [cluster].leader_fence_timeout_seconds` (a warm should finish within the leadership term that started it); the default (15 < the 20 fence) never trips this. |
| `warm_pool_target` | int | — | server DBs — how many connections to pre-open. Unset (default) = a safe fraction of the pool (`min(pool_size-1, pool_size//2)`), so the warm never pins more than half the pool; an explicit value is clamped to `pool_size-1`. A pool of 1 is never warmed. At the default `pool_size = 40` this is `min(39, 20) = 20` pre-opened per server-DB engine at startup. |
| `db_schema`, `application_name` | str | — / `messagefoundry` | optional (`db_schema` ⇒ env `MEFOR_STORE_DB_SCHEMA`) |
| `lease_ttl_seconds` | num (s) | 60 | server DBs — the **in-flight row-lease TTL**. A worker that claims a row stamps owner + `lease_expires_at = now + this`; a renew timer extends it while processing, and the `[cluster]` leader's reclaim sweep recovers only rows whose lease has **expired**, so a crashed node's work comes back without stealing a live sibling's in-flight rows. The lease is **wall-clock across nodes**, so set it comfortably above expected clock skew + the renew interval. A shared server-DB field: SQL Server and SQLite don't lease and ignore it. |
| `uploads_dir` | path | — | **Off unless set.** Enables the opt-in **uploaded-logs** surface (POST `/uploads` + the `/ui/uploaded-logs/upload` delegate, [ADR 0134](adr/0134-offline-uploaded-logs-viewer-connection-decoupled-upload-browse-resend-deletion-phi-at-rest-posture-stdlib-multipart.md)); a filesystem dir for operator-uploaded diagnostic logs. A storage **path**, not a secret. Unset = no PHI-at-rest upload surface exists. See [CONNECTIONS.md §"Uploaded-logs file policy"](CONNECTIONS.md#uploaded-logs-file-policy-asvs-511). |
| `max_upload_bytes` | int (bytes) | `26214400` (25 MiB) | Hard cap on a single uploaded file (`ge=1`, `le=512 MiB`). Bounds the multipart upload buffer and the offline whole-file split; the global 1 MiB HTTP body cap is raised to this value **only** on the two upload routes. |
| `max_upload_files_per_user` | int | `100` | Max number of uploaded diagnostic files one uploader may retain at once (ASVS 5.2.4, `ge=1`). A would-be 101st upload is refused **HTTP 409** (`upload.reject_quota`). **Default-on** once `uploads_dir` is set — the control cannot ship disabled. |
| `max_upload_total_bytes_per_user` | int (bytes) | `262144000` (250 MiB) | Max aggregate bytes of uploaded files one uploader may retain (ASVS 5.2.4, `ge=1`). An upload pushing the uploader's total over the cap is refused **HTTP 409**. Default-on. |
| `uploads_retention_days` | int (days) | `30` | Age after which an uploaded file (blob+meta pair) is pruned (ASVS 5.2.4, `ge=1`) — swept opportunistically at save time and by a periodic task; every prune audited (`upload.prune`, id + uploader only). Default-on. |

> Selecting `backend = "sqlserver"` validates that `server`/`database` (and `username` when

#### Per-backend capability matrix

Each row is a `supports_*` capability flag on the `QueueStore` protocol
([`store/base.py`](../messagefoundry/store/base.py)); each cell is the value the backend's store class
actually declares. The engine reads these flags to **fail closed at startup** — an unsupported feature is
refused before any message is accepted, never a silent degrade and never a post-ACK surprise.

| Capability flag | SQLite | Postgres | SQL Server |
|---|---|---|---|
| `supports_ingest_stage` | yes | yes | yes |
| `supports_response_capture` | yes | yes | yes |
| `supports_pt_reingress` | yes | yes | yes |
| `supports_streaming_attachments` | yes | yes | yes |
| `supports_fused_sync_handoff` | no | no | **yes** |
| `supports_reference_sets` | yes | yes | yes |

**Request/response capture ([ADR 0013](adr/0013-query-response-orchestration.md)), PT/`Loopback()`
re-ingress, and [ADR 0006](adr/0006-external-data-lookups.md) reference sets work on ALL THREE
backends** — including SQL Server, which has shipped `capture_response` + `reingress_to` at full parity
since #249 and the reference-snapshot store since [BACKLOG #235](BACKLOG.md) (2026-07-16, CI-proven
against real SQL Server 2022 + 2025). Do not read a backend limitation into any of those rows. (The
reference-set gate itself stays: a graph declaring a `Reference(...)` on a *future* backend that leaves
the allow-list default `False` is still refused at `messagefoundry check`, at engine start, and on
reload/promote.)

The one row that *does* vary:

- **`supports_fused_sync_handoff` — SQL Server only.** The fused synchronous handoff twins
  ([ADR 0071](adr/0071-cut-executor-round-trips-b5.md) B5) collapse a multi-statement handoff into one executor
  completion. The profiled wall is aioodbc's per-statement thread crossing, which only SQL Server pays:
  asyncpg is loop-native and SQLite's handoff lock is loop-affine, so neither has anything to fuse. SQL
  Server is the *most* capable backend here.

> **This table is pinned by `tests/test_store_capability_matrix.py`,** which parses it and asserts every
> cell against the live store-class attributes. Flip a flag or add a new one and you must update this
> table **in the same commit**, or the test fails. That is deliberate: the stale "backend X doesn't
> support Y" prose this table replaced once sent a team off to build a feature that already existed.

### `[api]`
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `host` | | | **→ moved to `[security].local_access_only` / `listen_address`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[api]`. |
| `port` | int | 8765 | |
| `expose_docs` | bool | `false` | serve `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json` (off by default — widens surface) |
| `config_reload_roots` | list[str] | `[]` | extra directories `POST /config/reload` may load from, besides the startup `--config` dir. The loader **executes Python** from these, so list only admin-owned, trusted roots (e.g. an IDE staging dir). Any reload path outside the startup dir + these roots is rejected (403). |
| `tls_cert_file` | str | _unset_ | **`[BUILT]` (WP-13a, ADR 0002):** PEM server-certificate path. **Setting it turns on in-process TLS** — the API serves `https`/`wss`, HSTS engages, and a non-loopback bind is allowed without `--allow-insecure-bind`. |
| `tls_key_file` | str | _unset_ | PEM private-key path (omit if the key is in the cert PEM). Requires `tls_cert_file`. |
| `tls_key_password` | secret | _unset_ | passphrase for an encrypted key — **env only** (`MEFOR_API_TLS_KEY_PASSWORD`), never the file. |
| `tls_min_version` | str | `1.2` | minimum negotiated TLS version floor (NIST SP 800-52r2): `1.2` or `1.3`. |
| `tls_ciphers` | str | _unset_ | optional OpenSSL cipher string (default = the interpreter's secure defaults). |
| `tls_client_ca_file` | str | _unset_ | CA bundle to **require + verify client certs** (opt-in mTLS, e.g. the console). Requires `tls_cert_file`. |
| `tls_client_ca_pin` | str | _unset_ | optional lowercase-hex SHA-256 pin over the corresponding CA anchor PEM (`tls_client_ca_file`); a mismatch refuses at load + reload (ASVS 6.7.1); unset = no pin (dormant). |
| `tls_client_cert_identities` | map str→str | `{}` | **(#200, ADR 0002):** mTLS client-cert → MessageFoundry principal map. Meaningful only with in-process mTLS (`tls_client_ca_file` set, so uvicorn `CERT_REQUIRED`-verifies the peer): a **verified** peer cert's subject CN / SAN is resolved to an existing username through this **allow-list**, and that principal's RBAC authorizes the request — a service-to-service identity that carries no bearer token. Keys are the qualified cert name `CN:<commonName>` or `SAN:<type>:<value>` (e.g. `SAN:DNS:svc.internal`); values are existing usernames. **Deny-by-default:** an unmapped verified cert — or a spoofed CN not listed here — resolves to no identity and is denied. A structured map, so **TOML-only** (no env-string form). Empty (the default) disables cert-identity. **Honest caveat:** stock uvicorn does not surface the peer cert to the ASGI scope, so the resolver is **inert** until a TLS-extension-capable server/shim populates it. |
| `tls_client_cert_files` | list[str] | `[]` | **(ASVS 6.4.5):** PEM paths of **inbound service callers'** client certs you hold a copy of. Folded into the [`[cert_monitor]`](#cert_monitor) scan, so a caller's cert expiry is caught **even while that caller has stopped connecting** — the handshake-time check can only see a cert still being presented. These are certs the engine *verifies*, not ones it *presents*, so the served-cert scan cannot see them. Public certificates only (never a key); empty = off. |
| `trusted_proxies` | list[str] | `[]` | **`[BUILT]` (WP-15):** reverse-proxy IP(s) whose `X-Forwarded-For`/`-Proto` are trusted (uvicorn `forwarded_allow_ips`), so the audit/rate-limit source IP is the **real client**, not the proxy. **Empty = trust nothing** (the direct TCP peer is used). Set ONLY to the proxy's address(es), or XFF spoofing returns — every host inside an entry may declare its own source address, so a broad range (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8` on a LAN numbered out of 10/8) makes every workstation a trusted spoofer. `"*"` and unparseable entries are **refused at load** (uvicorn would silently treat the latter as a never-matching literal, collapsing every client to the proxy). |
| `tls_terminated_upstream` | bool | `false` | **`[BUILT]` (WP-15):** declare that a reverse proxy / load balancer terminates TLS in front of the engine. Lets a non-loopback bind satisfy the TLS gate **without** in-process TLS — but only when `trusted_proxies` is set (else refused at load). |
| `proxy_intra_service_auth` | enum | `none` | **Posture-B operator attestation (#200, ADR 0002)** — *how* the proxy→engine hop is authenticated, so a rogue peer on the internal segment cannot impersonate the proxy. `none` (the default) is **undeclared**; declare `mtls` (the proxy presents a client cert), `network` (an isolated proxy↔engine segment / host firewall allow-list) or `shared_secret` (a pre-shared header the proxy injects). **Attestation only — the engine enforces nothing at run time**; it is the record that the hop was considered. Left undeclared under `tls_terminated_upstream` on a PHI instance, `serve` **refuses** when `[security].enforcement = enforce` **and** the bind is non-loopback, and **warns** otherwise (including the recommended loopback-behind-proxy topology). |
| `proxy_tls_min_version` | str | _unset_ | the operator-**declared** TLS version floor the reverse proxy negotiates with browsers: `1.2` or `1.3` (NIST SP 800-52r2) — any other value is refused at load. The engine terminates no browser TLS in Posture-B, so it cannot inspect the proxy's negotiated version (ASVS 11.6.2); this is the attested floor, validated only for coherence. Unset = undeclared, gated exactly like `proxy_intra_service_auth` above. |
| `proxy_tls_ciphers` | str | _unset_ | an **optional** declared OpenSSL cipher list for that proxy floor. When set it must resolve to forward-secret (EC)DHE suites (ASVS 11.6.2) — the same validator `tls_ciphers` uses — so a declared floor can't itself name a non-forward-secret key exchange. Unset = no cipher declaration; it is **not** required to satisfy the Posture-B gate (only `proxy_intra_service_auth` + `proxy_tls_min_version` are). |
| `serve_ui` | | | **→ moved to `[security].serve_web_console`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[api]`. |
| `serve_ui_explicit` | bool | `false` | **Internal plumbing — not an operator knob.** The loader sets it `true` when `[security].serve_web_console` was **explicitly** provided (at either value), so `serve` can tell an explicit `serve_web_console = true` with the console wheel absent (**hard refuse** — the operator asked for the console by name) from the default-on posture with the wheel absent (JSON-only serve + a warning, never a start failure). Set `[security].serve_web_console`, not this. |
| `public_origin` | | | **→ moved to `[security].web_console_public_address`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[api]`. |
| `ws_allowed_origins` | list[str] | `[]` | browser `Origin` allowlist for the **native/bearer** `/ws/stats` path only — NOT the `/ui` browser WebSocket (that authorizes via the cookie + `public_origin`/Host match). Don't conflate the two knobs. |

### `[tls]` — outbound client trust anchors
Instance-wide **client trust-anchor policy** (#190, [ADR 0093](adr/0093-pinned-internal-ca-trust-anchor.md)) —
a small shared fallback for the outbound connectors that verify a downstream *server* certificate (MLLP,
DICOM, FTPS today). By default the OS trust store roots verify the peer; a hospital estate whose internal
endpoints present a private/internal-CA certificate can pin that CA **once** here instead of installing it
box-globally or repeating a per-connection `tls_ca_file`. This selects **which** roots verify the peer — it
**never disables verification** — so it composes with (never weakens) the connectors' fail-closed no-CA /
`tls_verify=false` / cleartext-hop refusals. A connection naming its **own** `tls_ca_file` always wins
verbatim, and a loopback hop is exempt. The default is a no-op: a config with no `[tls]` block builds a
byte-identical SSL context.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `internal_ca_file` | path | — | PEM path to the org's internal CA. **Not a secret** — a path, like `tls_cert_file` / `forward_tls_ca_file`. Unset (default) = no internal anchor; every hop uses the OS trust store. |
| `trust_anchor_mode` | enum | `system` | how `internal_ca_file` composes with the OS default roots on a non-loopback internal hop. `system` (default) = **OS trust store only**, `internal_ca_file` ignored (byte-identical). `augment` = OS roots **and** the internal CA (a mixed public + private estate). `pinned` = **only** the internal CA, not the public bundle (a fully-private estate; strictest). `pinned` **without** `internal_ca_file` is **refused at load** — with nothing to pin it would silently fall back to the full OS trust store, i.e. the operator excludes public roots and gets all of them. |

### `[inbound]` — inbound listener defaults
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bind_host` | str | `127.0.0.1` | the **default** network interface every inbound MLLP/TCP listener binds to. Authors never set a `host` on an inbound connection (a wiring error if they do) — it's a per-environment operator decision here. Binding `0.0.0.0` exposes unauthenticated MLLP to the network, so it's deliberate (DEV typically loopback, PROD a specific NIC behind a firewall). A non-loopback bind **requires `tls=true`** on each MLLP connection (the §0 exposed-gate refuses a plaintext off-loopback listener at startup) unless `serve --allow-insecure-bind` is passed. A single connection may override this with a per-connection `bind_address` (and restrict peers with `source_ip_allowlist`) — MLLP/TCP only; see [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md). |
| `ack_after` | enum | `ingest` | the **default** ACK timing every inbound inherits (staged pipeline, [ADR 0001](adr/0001-staged-pipeline-architecture.md)). `ingest` = ACK-on-receipt, once the raw message is durably committed to the ingress stage and **before** routing/transform/delivery. `delivered` (defer the ACK until delivery succeeds) is **not built** — wiring it raises a `WiringError`, so it fails loud rather than silently ACKing early. A connection's own `ack_after=` overrides this. |
| `stream_inflight_budget_bytes` | int (bytes) | `0` | aggregate cap on the **total** bytes of over-threshold message bodies concurrently mid-detach across **all** inbounds (#149, [ADR 0105](adr/0105-streaming-very-large-hl7-attachments-detach-the-opaque-document-from-the-transformable-skeleton.md)). A detach that would push the running total over it is refused with backpressure (the message is NAK'd/`ERROR`'d, never accepted-and-dropped), so a burst of very large documents can't exhaust memory. `0` (default) = unlimited — a *single* body is still bounded by the per-connection `max_message_bytes`. Only over-threshold streaming detaches count against it. |

### `[environments]` — per-environment graph values (DEV/PROD)
The **same** code-first graph runs in every environment; only the values it references via
[`env("key")`](../messagefoundry/config/wiring.py) differ. The **active** environment is the single
cross-cutting selector **`[ai].environment`** — a **free-form name** (ADR 0017), set in the TOML or via
`serve --env <name>`, and **required** (no default); this section only locates the value files.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dir` | str | `environments` | directory holding `<env>.toml` flat key→value tables for non-secret values, **versioned** in the repo. Resolved against `base_dir` (below). |
| `base_dir` | str | `""` (= the working dir) | **Anchor** `dir` resolves against. Empty keeps the original behavior (relative to the process working directory). Set it to the **config-repo root** so env-value resolution no longer depends on where `serve` was launched. A relative value is taken against the working dir; an absolute value is used as-is — **on Windows it must be drive-qualified** (`C:/repo`); a leading-slash `/repo` is drive-relative and still inherits the launch drive (logged as a warning). Overridable per run with `serve --project-root`. |

- A graph value that differs by environment is authored as `env("acme_adt_host")`; the running
  instance resolves it from `<base_dir>/<dir>/<active-env>.toml` overlaid by **`MEFOR_VALUE_<KEY>`**
  env vars (secrets — never the file; env wins). Keys are `lower_snake_case`.
- **Anchoring the value files (`base_dir` / `--project-root`).** A standalone **config repo** (ADR
  0017) keeps `environments/` at its root — a *sibling* of the `--config` dir. With the default
  (empty) `base_dir`, the files resolve relative to the **process working directory**, so a `serve`
  launched from anywhere but the repo root reads **no** env values (a silent empty table, not an
  error — the missing values then fail loud only when a connector is built). This bites most under
  **NSSM**, whose working directory is rarely the repo. Pin the anchor so resolution is
  launch-independent — in the instance's `messagefoundry.toml`:
  ```toml
  [environments]
  base_dir = "C:/srv/acme-config"   # the config-repo root; environments/<env>.toml live under it
  ```
  or per run: `messagefoundry serve --config config --env prod --project-root C:/srv/acme-config`
  (the flag overrides `[environments].base_dir`; precedence is CLI > env > file > default, like every
  service setting). The startup log prints the **resolved** `environments/<env>.toml` path so you can
  confirm where values are read from. Running from the repo root keeps working unchanged (the empty
  default is the working dir).
- A referenced key that is **undefined for the target environment** makes the engine refuse to load
  or promote that graph (fail loud) — never a silent blank host. See the env files under
  [`environments/`](../environments/) and `samples/config/IB_ACME_ADT.py` for a worked example.
- **Per-face logic inside a transform:** `env()` is a *deferred reference* resolved only when a
  **connection** spec is built — using it in a handler is an always-truthy object (a bug). To branch a
  Router/Handler on the deployment, read the active environment **name** with
  [`current_environment()`](../messagefoundry/config/active_environment.py) (the free-form name, e.g.
  `"prod"`/`"test"`, or `None` in a dry-run):
  ```python
  from messagefoundry import current_environment
  # Corepoint: If ActiveFace="Test" Then MSH-11.1 = "T"
  if current_environment() in ("staging", "dev"):
      msg.set("MSH-11.1", "T")
  ```
  The active environment is a deployment constant, so the read is pure + re-run-safe.

### Code sets — reference lookup tables (`codesets/`)
A code-first Router/Handler often needs a **reference table** — an Epic diet code → a food-service
system value, a facility code → a downstream mnemonic. Rather than a hand-maintained Python dict, drop the table in a
**code set** and look it up with [`code_set("name")`](../messagefoundry/config/code_sets.py).

- **Where.** Files live in `codesets/` **relative to the `--config` dir** — a config bundle carries
  its own reference tables and they **reload with the graph** (POST `/config/reload`). This is distinct
  from `environments/` (cwd-level endpoint values for `env()`). A missing `codesets/` dir is fine
  (no code sets). The code-set **name** is the file's stem (`codesets/epic_diets.csv` → `"epic_diets"`).
- **CSV** (`<name>.csv`) — a header row; the **first column is the lookup key**. One other column →
  the value is that scalar (`str`); several other columns → the value is a `dict` `{header: cell}`. A
  duplicate key is a **load error** (fail loud).
- **TOML** (`<name>.toml`) — a flat table `key = value` → `{key: scalar}`; a nested `[key]` table →
  `{key: {…}}` (mirrors the `environments/<env>.toml` shape).
- **Usage.** Capture once at a module's top level (preferred) or look it up at call time inside a
  handler — both resolve:
  ```python
  from messagefoundry import code_set, handler, Send

  DIET = code_set("epic_diets")          # frozen, read-only mapping; captured at import

  @handler("to_dietary")
  def handle(msg):
      msg["ODS-3"] = DIET.get(msg["ODS-3"], "")     # .get(key, default) — blank on a miss
      fac = code_set("facility_mnemonics").get(msg["MSH-4"])  # call-time lookup also works
      ...
      return Send("OB_DIETARY", msg)
  ```
  A `CodeSet` is a read-only `Mapping`: `cs[key]` (raises `KeyError` naming the set on a miss),
  `cs.get(key, default)`, `key in cs`, `len(cs)`, iteration. It is **frozen** — one instance is shared
  across transforms, so a handler must never mutate the reference data.
- **Fail loud.** `code_set("missing")` (no such file) or a malformed/duplicate-key CSV/TOML raises a
  `WiringError`, surfaced by `validate` / `messagefoundry check` / reload exactly like a missing
  `env()` value — never a silent empty table.
- **Purity caveat.** The lookup is pure (key in → value out), so it's compatible with the staged
  pipeline's **pure-re-run** invariant ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-staged-pipeline-architecture.md) /
  CLAUDE.md §2). The one caveat: a hot-reload that **changes** a table between a run and a
  crash-re-run can make the re-run derive a different output. That's acceptable for reference data (a
  code set is deliberately operator-editable, and a reload is an explicit, audited act), but it is the
  one way a transform's re-run can legitimately differ — note it where you document the transform.
- **Editing — by hand or from the IDE.** A code set is a plain `codesets/<name>.csv` you can edit in any
  editor, **and** a GUI-manageable artifact ([ADR 0033](adr/0033-gui-manageable-code-sets.md)). The VS
  Code extension opens a **grid editor** (rows × columns of strings — the first column is the lookup
  key) to **create / edit / rename / delete** a translation table; it shells a new
  **`messagefoundry codeset`** CLI that owns validation and the atomic write. Both editors write the
  same file (CSV-first), so a hand edit and a GUI save are interchangeable — mirroring the connections
  editor ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-gui-manageable-connections-toml.md)).
  - `messagefoundry codeset list  --config DIR` — summarize every set under `codesets/` (`.csv` **and**
    `.toml`; TOML sets are summarized and shown **read-only** in the grid — TOML-in-grid editing is a
    fast-follow).
  - `messagefoundry codeset show   --config DIR --name N` — the grid (headers + rows).
  - `messagefoundry codeset upsert --config DIR --data '{…}'` — validate → write `codesets/N.csv`
    atomically (temp + replace, owner-only perms) → **re-load the written file as the final check**;
    a bad save rolls back, so the CLI never leaves an unloadable table.
  - `messagefoundry codeset rename --config DIR --name N --to M` / `… remove --config DIR --name N`.

  The CLI is **offline** (no engine start, no egress check — a code set is standalone data); it validates
  against the **same loader** that runs at startup, and the operator-supplied **name is treated as
  untrusted data** (rejecting path separators, `..`, absolute/drive paths, and an embedded extension, so
  a name can't escape `codesets/`). Apply a change with the existing audited promote/reload below.
- **Promote to apply (rename/remove caveat).** Editing a `codesets/` file changes nothing live; the
  running graph adopts the change only through **`POST /config/reload`** (the IDE promote), exactly like
  a connection or handler change. **Renaming or removing a code set can break a handler reference** — a
  `code_set("old_name")` call then raises at run time (that message's `ERROR` disposition). A plain
  `validate` only confirms each file parses, so it **won't** catch a now-dangling reference; **run
  `messagefoundry check` after a rename/remove**, whose dry-run executes the transforms and surfaces the
  broken `code_set(...)` lookup before you promote. See [docs/CODESETS.md](CODESETS.md) for the full grid
  editor + CLI reference.

### Transform state — cross-message correlation ([ADR 0005](adr/0005-transform-accessible-state.md))

Where code sets are **read-only** reference data, **transform state** is **read/write** correlation
data a Handler accumulates across messages: an anonymous-patient mapping (persist a real MRN → a stable
anonymized id and reuse it on later messages), order↔result correlation, running aggregates. It is
authored against two surfaces from `messagefoundry`:

```python
from messagefoundry import handler, Send, SetState, state_get

@handler("anonymize")
def anonymize(msg):
    mrn = msg["PID-3.1"]
    anon = state_get("patient_anon", mrn)          # synchronous read; None on a miss
    ops = []
    if anon is None:
        anon = derive_anon_id(mrn)                  # deterministic derivation preferred (see below)
        ops.append(SetState("patient_anon", mrn, anon))
    msg["PID-3.1"] = anon
    return [Send("OB_DOWNSTREAM", msg), *ops]       # Sends and SetStates, mixed in one list
```

- **Write contract — declared, never imperative.** A Handler returns
  `Send | SetState | list[Send | SetState] | None`; it does **not** mutate state directly. Each
  `SetState(namespace, key, value)` (the `value` must be JSON-serializable — validated at construction)
  is an **upsert by `(namespace, key)`** the engine applies **inside the routed→outbound handoff
  transaction**. `Send`-only Handlers are unchanged — fully **backward compatible**.
- **Exactly-once / re-run safety.** Because the write commits in the **same transaction** as the
  outbound rows, a crash before commit leaves **no** state (atomic with the handoff) and the attempt
  that commits applies the write **exactly once per message** — this preserves the staged pipeline's
  **pure-re-run** invariant ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-staged-pipeline-architecture.md) / CLAUDE.md §2). A
  non-deterministic value (a random anon id) is still safe because only the committed attempt persists,
  but **prefer a deterministic derivation** where cross-run identity matters.
- **Read — synchronous, read-through cache.** Handlers are pure synchronous functions and a DB read is
  async, so `state_get(namespace, key, default=None)` reads an in-memory **read-through cache** the
  engine maintains (loaded at startup, updated as writes commit) and publishes around each
  router/transform run — exactly how `code_set()` resolves against an active set. A missing key returns
  `default` (state is sparse, not a referenced table). **Non-linearization caveat:** a read reflects
  committed state as of its invocation, but is **not** linearized with a concurrent sibling handler's
  write — fine for read-mostly correlation; a race-sensitive read-modify-write within one namespace
  needs author care.
- **Encryption at rest.** State values may carry PHI (MRN↔id), so they are AES-256-GCM-encrypted with
  the store cipher just like `messages.raw`, and covered by key rotation (`messagefoundry rotate-key`).
- **Retention (TTL).** Set `[retention].state_max_age_days` to age out stale entries (a global age
  purge; per-namespace policy is a follow-up). Off by default = keep forever. The whole-table cache
  assumes **bounded** state — unbounded estates (every MRN ever seen) are a documented follow-up
  ([ADR 0005](adr/0005-transform-accessible-state.md)).
- **SQL Server.** State writes ride the staged `transform_handoff`, which is implemented on the SQL
  Server backend, so the `state` table is **live** (parity with SQLite/Postgres); the read-through
  cache refreshes post-commit. Cross-node state convergence is N/A (single-node backend).

`state_get` also resolves in **dry-run** / the IDE Test Bench / `messagefoundry check`: each simulated
message gets a fresh in-memory view that accumulates that run's own declared writes (so a later handler
sees an earlier one's `SetState`), and `dryrun` output lists the declared state ops — **PHI-gated**
behind `--show-phi` like a message body.

### Reference sets — external-data enrichment ([ADR 0006](adr/0006-external-data-lookups.md))

Where a **code set** is a static lookup table shipped in the bundle and **transform state** is
read/write correlation, a **reference set** is **external data materialized off the message path**: a
provider directory, a DB-backed translation table (the Corepoint Data Point / DB Association pattern).
The engine syncs the source into a **versioned, encrypted store snapshot** on a cadence; a Handler
reads it **purely** at run time. Because the read carries no external call, the staged pipeline's
pure-re-run invariant holds (the only non-determinism is a snapshot flip landing between a run and a
crash-re-run — the same accepted caveat as a code-set hot-reload).

- **Declare** a set in a wiring module (registers it into the graph, like `inbound`):
  ```python
  from messagefoundry import Reference, FileRef, env, handler, Send, reference

  Reference("provider_npi", source=FileRef(path=env("provider_npi_csv")), refresh_seconds=3600)

  @handler("enrich")
  def enrich(msg):
      npi = reference("provider_npi").get(msg["PV1-7.1"])   # pure dict lookup, no I/O
      if npi:
          msg.set("PV1-7.13", npi)
      return Send("OB_DOWNSTREAM", msg)
  ```
- **`reference(name)`** returns a frozen, read-only `ReferenceSet` (`rs[k]` / `rs.get(k, d)` / `k in rs`).
  A missing **key** returns the default (external data is sparse); a missing/unsynced **set** raises
  (fail loud) at run time → that message's `ERROR` disposition. Call it **inside a Handler/Router**, not
  at module top level (the snapshot exists only once the store is open + synced — unlike `code_set`).
- **Sources:** `FileRef(path=…, encoding=…)` — a local CSV/TOML in the **code-set format**, re-read on
  the refresh cadence (the path for an externally-produced export; `path` may be `env()`).
  `DatabaseRef(server=…, database=…, statement=…, key_column=…, value_column=…)` — the engine runs a
  read-only SQL query on the cadence (SQL Server via the `[sqlserver]` extra, **production / supported**; secrets
  via `env()`; the dial-out is gated by the fail-closed `[egress].allowed_db` allowlist). `key_column`
  is the lookup key; `value_column` (if set) is the value, else the value is a dict of the other columns.
- **Sync.** The engine's `ReferenceSyncRunner` materializes each set once at startup (before listeners
  serve, so `reference(...)` resolves on the first message) and every `refresh_seconds`. A source
  failure is **isolated**: it's logged + alerted and the **last-good snapshot is kept** (the write
  isn't attempted), so one bad source never blocks the others or the message path.
- **At rest:** snapshot values are AES-GCM-encrypted (they may carry PHI) and covered by key rotation,
  exactly like `state`/message bodies; the fail-closed `[egress].allowed_db` allowlist gates the
  `DatabaseRef` source's dial-out. The snapshot store ships on **all three backends** — SQLite,
  Postgres, and SQL Server ([BACKLOG #235](BACKLOG.md), 2026-07-16).
- **`[reference]` settings:** the sync cadence + startup behaviour — catalogued in
  [`[reference]`](#reference) immediately below.
- **Dry-run / `check`** resolve file-backed sets best-effort (literal paths) so a reference-using
  transform validates; DB-backed or `env()`-path sets are absent in a pure dry-run.

### `[reference]`
The sync knobs behind the reference sets above ([ADR 0006](adr/0006-external-data-lookups.md) Tier 1),
enforced by the engine's `ReferenceSyncRunner`
([pipeline/reference_sync.py](../messagefoundry/pipeline/reference_sync.py)). The runner is a **no-op when
no sets are declared**, so these defaults are safe on an existing deployment.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `refresh_interval_seconds` | float (s) | `3600` | base cadence the sync loop ticks at; each set re-materializes when its own `refresh_seconds` is due. Must be `> 0` (refused at load otherwise). |
| `sync_on_startup` | bool | `true` | materialize every declared set once at startup, **before** inbound listeners begin serving, so a transform's `reference(...)` resolves on the very first message. Strongly recommended on. |
| `max_staleness_seconds` | float (s) | `0` | **reserved / not enforced** — the intended freshness guard (alert/refuse when the active snapshot is older than this). Accepted so a forward-looking file still loads; `0` = off. Must be `>= 0`. |

### `[auth]` — authentication & RBAC
Implemented (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). Authentication is **required** by default; the AD bind
password is a **secret** supplied via env (`MEFOR_AUTH_AD_BIND_PASSWORD`), never the file.
The full inventory of resource-demanding functionality the `*_rate_limit_*` throttles below defend —
including the surfaces that remain **unbounded** at this release — is
security/THREAT-MODEL.md §Resource-demanding functionality (ASVS 15.1.3), a maintainer-internal
document ([SECURITY-DOCS-POLICY.md](SECURITY-DOCS-POLICY.md)).

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | | | **→ moved to `[security].require_sign_in`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[auth]`. |
| `session_idle_timeout_minutes` | | | **→ moved to `[security].sign_out_after_idle_minutes`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[auth]`. |
| `session_absolute_hours` | | | **→ moved to `[security].max_session_hours`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[auth]`. |
| `max_sessions_per_user` | int | 5 | cap concurrent sessions per user (ASVS 7.1.2; `0` = unlimited); a login beyond the cap revokes the user's oldest active session |
| `step_up_max_age_seconds` | int | 300 | **step-up re-verification window** (ASVS 7.5.3): a highly sensitive operation requires the session to have re-verified its credential — at login or via `POST /me/reauth` — within this many seconds. The initial login counts as the first verification (the sudo-timestamp model) |
| `require_action_step_up` | bool | `true` | **action-bound step-up** ([ADR 0077](adr/0077-action-bound-step-up.md); ASVS 7.5.1/8.2.4). On by default: the durable-takeover JSON routes — TOTP enroll/confirm and disable-MFA — require a fresh proof **bound to that specific action** (`POST /me/reauth` with a matching `purpose`, single-use) instead of riding the session-wide `step_up_max_age_seconds` window. It closes the most-exploitable default: a session hijacked inside the 300 s login-seeded window could otherwise bind an attacker's authenticator with no fresh proof. It changes **only** those factor-binding routes — the broad admin / replay / config / purge routes keep the session-window step-up. `false` reverts to the legacy session-window behaviour (0.2.x semantics), the documented org opt-out |
| `password_min_length` | int | 15 | local-password policy — ASVS 5.0-aligned, length-first |
| `password_require_uppercase` / `password_require_lowercase` / `password_require_digit` / `password_require_symbol` | bool | `false` | character classes — **opt-in**, each independently (ASVS 5.0 forbids mandatory composition); turn one on only for a legacy standard that still mandates it |
| `password_check_breached` | bool | `true` | reject known common/breached passwords against a bundled offline top-10k list (no live HIBP call) |
| `password_check_context` | bool | `true` | reject passwords containing app/vendor/HL7 terms (e.g. `messagefoundry`, `mefor`, `hl7`, `corepoint`) |
| `password_check_username` | bool | `true` | reject a password containing the user's **own username** (ASVS 6.2.11) |
| `password_breach_corpus_file` | path | — | optional path to a **larger offline breach corpus** that augments the bundled top-10k list (ASVS 6.2.12): a plaintext list **or** an HIBP-style SHA-1 hash export (`HASH[:count]` lines, auto-detected). Fully offline — still no live HIBP call. Use a curated subset, not the full ~40 GB HIBP set (it is loaded into memory). A path, not a secret |
| `lockout_threshold` | int | 5 | failed logins before lock (per account) |
| `lockout_minutes` | int | 15 | lockout duration |
| `bootstrap_expiry_hours` | int | 72 | the first-run bootstrap admin is auto-disabled once a second administrator exists, and — while still unclaimed (never password-changed) — this many hours after creation. `0` = no time expiry |
| `bootstrap_warn_hours` | int | 24 | **(ASVS 6.4.5):** how long *before* that deadline to remind an operator that the still-unclaimed bootstrap credential is about to be retired — a **`bootstrap_admin_expiring`** [`[alerts]`](#alerts) event, raised once while `now` is inside `[expiry − this, expiry)`. Advisory only (it disables nothing); meaningful only when `bootstrap_expiry_hours > 0`. The deadline itself is also written into `bootstrap-admin.txt` at issuance. |
| `initial_password_expiry_hours` | int | 72 | **(ASVS 6.4.1):** an admin-issued initial/reset credential (a `must_change_password` temp password) that is never claimed **expires** this many hours after it was set. Without it an unused reset password grants an authenticated session indefinitely — and the one action it permits is to *set the password*, i.e. account takeover. Keyed on `password_changed_at`; a user who set their own password has `must_change_password = false` and is unaffected, and the bootstrap admin has its own `bootstrap_expiry_hours` path (exempt). `0` = no expiry (not recommended on a PHI instance) |
| `login_rate_limit_enabled` | bool | `true` | in-process sliding-window limiter on the **sign-in surface** — `/auth/login`, `/auth/negotiate`, `/auth/mfa-verify` plus the four console entry routes (`POST /ui/login`, `GET /ui/sso`, `GET /ui/oidc/start`, `GET /ui/oidc/callback`) — in front of the per-account lockout. The **same flag** also constructs the per-actor **credential-ceremony** limiter covering `/me/password`, `/me/reauth`, `/me/mfa/confirm` (+ the console re-auth routes); turning it off removes **both** (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) "Route → limiter map"). |
| `login_rate_limit_per_ip` | int | 10 | max attempts per client IP per window (`0` disables). **One number, two limiters:** it is also the per-**actor** budget of the credential-**ceremony** limiter (`/me/password`, `/me/reauth`, `/me/mfa/confirm` + the console re-auth routes) — the `_per_ip` name is historical, and retuning it retunes both |
| `login_rate_limit_global` | int | 60 | max attempts across all clients per window (`0` disables). Sign-in window only — the ceremony limiter has **no** global dimension (`glob=0`) |
| `login_rate_limit_window_seconds` | float | 60 | sliding-window length — shared by the sign-in window **and** the per-actor credential-**ceremony** limiter, exactly as `login_rate_limit_per_ip` is |
| `phi_read_rate_limit_enabled` | bool | `true` | per-actor anti-automation throttle (ASVS 2.4.1) — bounds scripted PHI harvesting on top of pagination + access auditing. Charged on **7 JSON routes** via `require_phi_read`, on the **4 bulk-PHI step-up GETs** at admission (`/messages/search`, `/messages/export`, `/uploads/{file_id}/messages`, `/search/layered` — `require_step_up` paces NON-GET only, so these charge it themselves), and on the **5 `/ui` PHI views** via `require_ui(…, phi=True)` |
| `phi_read_rate_limit_per_actor` | int | 120 | max PHI reads per user per window (generous — clears console/human use; `0` disables this dimension) |
| `phi_read_rate_limit_global` | int | 0 | max PHI reads across all users per window (`0` = off) |
| `phi_read_rate_limit_window_seconds` | float | 60 | sliding-window length |
| `admin_write_rate_limit_enabled` | bool | `true` | per-actor anti-automation pacing on the **state-changing admin surface** (ASVS 2.4.2) — **NON-GET only**, charged from one per-actor bucket by both `require_step_up` and `require_paced`. JSON API only: no `/ui` route charges it today ([BACKLOG #287](BACKLOG.md)) |
| `admin_write_rate_limit_per_actor` | int | 12 | max state-changing admin writes per actor per window (`0` disables this dimension); there is deliberately **no global arm** — one operator's bulk work must never throttle another's |
| `admin_write_rate_limit_window_seconds` | float | 1.0 | sliding-window length; over budget → `429` + `Retry-After: 1`, refused before any further work |
| `notify_security_events` | bool | `true` | email the affected user on lockout / first-success-after-failures / password-email-role-disable changes (ASVS 6.3.5/6.3.7). Reuses the `[alerts]` SMTP transport, sent to the user's own address; no SMTP configured → email skipped. The `GET /me/security-events` feed (over the audit log) is always available regardless of this toggle. On a **PHI production** instance this push must be *effective* — see `[alerts].security_notifications_required` (BACKLOG #188). |
| `require_mfa` | | | **→ moved to `[security].require_mfa`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[auth]`. |
| `require_mfa_scope` | | | **→ set it as `[security].require_mfa_scope`** (ADR 0118) — like its `require_mfa` sibling it is rejected in `[auth]`. |
| `totp_skew_steps` | int | `0` | TOTP clock-skew tolerance in 30 s steps applied at verify time (BACKLOG #187, ASVS 6.5.5). **Default `0` = STRICT: only the current 30 s step verifies** (tightest replay window — a captured code is valid at most for the rest of its own step). Set `1` (or `2`) — the documented opt-out — to restore RFC-6238 network-delay / clock-drift tolerance (`1` also accepts the immediately-prior and the fast-clock-clamped next step, i.e. the historical ±1 behaviour; the forward step is clamped to the current step so it never advances the single-use high-water mark). Range 0–2. |
| `mfa_recovery_code_count` | int | 10 | single-use recovery codes minted at TOTP enrollment (the lost-authenticator escape hatch; `0` disables them, leaving an admin reset as the only recovery path). Range 0–50. |
| `admin_new_ip_step_up` | bool | `false` | admin-interface contextual-risk signal (WP-L3-13, ASVS 8.4.2): when on, a step-up (sensitive admin) request from a client IP the session has not verified from emits an `auth.admin_action_new_ip` audit + notice and **forces a fresh step-up** (a re-verify from that address clears it). Advisory + step-up-forcing only — never changes an RBAC decision, never blocks the non-admin path; the audit + notice fire once per (session, new address). Off by default (byte-identical on loopback — `127.0.0.1` and `::1` are treated as one host); recommended on for an off-loopback admin deployment. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) "Administrative-interface defense-in-depth". |
| `ad_enabled` | bool | `false` | turn on Active Directory login |
| `ad_server` | str | — | e.g. `ldaps://dc1.example.com:636` (required when `ad_enabled`) |
| `ad_domain` | str | — | UPN suffix, e.g. `example.com` |
| `ad_user_search_base` | str | — | required when `ad_enabled` |
| `ad_group_search_base` | str | — | base for nested-group resolution |
| `ad_bind_dn` | str | — | service-account DN used for lookups |
| `ad_bind_password` | secret | — | **env only** (`MEFOR_AUTH_AD_BIND_PASSWORD`), or use `ad_bind_password_secret` |
| `ad_bind_password_secret` | str | — | connector `SecretProvider` reference (ADR 0019 §5) — when set and `[secrets].provider` is configured, the bind password is resolved from that backend (e.g. a Vault KV `path#field`) instead of `ad_bind_password`. A reference, not a secret. |
| `ad_use_nested_groups` | bool | `true` | resolve nested groups (`LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN`) |
| `ad_tls_verify` | bool | `true` | validate the LDAPS certificate |
| `ad_tls_ca_cert_file` | str | — | trust an internal CA for LDAPS without disabling verification |
| `ad_tls_ca_cert_pin` | str | — | optional lowercase-hex SHA-256 pin over the corresponding CA anchor PEM (`ad_tls_ca_cert_file`); a mismatch refuses at load + reload (ASVS 6.7.1); unset = no pin (dormant) |
| `ad_allow_insecure_ldap` | bool | `false` | explicit opt-in to a non-`ldaps://` bind (trusted-network dev only) |
| `ad_connect_timeout` | float | `10.0` | seconds — bounds the LDAP/LDAPS **TCP connect** on every `ldap3` `Server` the authenticator builds (ASVS 13.1.3). Must be finite and `> 0`; `0`, negative, `inf` and `NaN` are refused at config load. `ldap3`'s own default is `None` (wait forever), so without this an unresponsive DC pinned a thread-pool worker indefinitely |
| `ad_receive_timeout` | float | `10.0` | seconds — bounds **each LDAP response read** (both binds and every search) on every `ldap3` `Connection`. Same finite-positive validation |
| `ad_session_recheck_seconds` | int | `300` | **Directory session reconciliation** ([ADR 0079](adr/0079-kerberos-idp-session-coordination.md) mechanism 2). How often to re-resolve directory principals holding **live** sessions and revoke those AD has disabled or deleted — without it, an AD disable does not take effect until the `[security].max_session_hours` cap (12 h). **`300` (five minutes) is the default** (ADR 0148 GIVEN 1 — the hardened path is the shipped path), floored at **60 s** (a pass costs one LDAP bind per signed-in directory user). `0` disables the loop and is a **loosening** once AD is on — `security_loosenings()` names it. The default is **inert without AD** (`should_reconcile()` also needs an LDAP client), so a non-AD deployment is unaffected; an **explicit** non-zero value without `ad_enabled` is still refused rather than left silently dead. |
| `ad_session_recheck_strikes` | int | `2` | Consecutive passes a principal must fail to resolve before its sessions are revoked. The directory lookup collapses *disabled*, *deleted* and *the search matched nothing* into one answer, so a single ambiguous result must never revoke. Range 1–10. |
| `ad_session_recheck_max_users` | int | `200` | Per-pass bind budget. Beyond this, remaining users are picked up by later passes (least-recently-probed first), so a large estate degrades to a longer effective interval instead of a bind storm. |
| `ad_session_revoke_max` | int | `5` | **Mass-revoke circuit breaker**, absolute half. A bad search base / moved OU / service account that lost read rights answers "not found" for *every* user — indistinguishable from "everyone was disabled". |
| `ad_session_revoke_max_fraction` | float | `0.34` | Circuit breaker, proportional half. A pass exceeding **both** thresholds aborts, revokes nothing, logs at ERROR and writes an `auth.ad_reconcile_aborted` audit row. Requiring both means it fires only on a change simultaneously *large* and *broad* — the signature of a misconfiguration, not of offboarding (3-of-3 or 50-of-300 still applies). Range >0.0–1.0; `1.0` disables the proportional half. |
| `kerberos_enabled` | bool | `false` | Windows SSO (experimental, **not yet available**; needs `ad_enabled`) |
| `kerberos_spn` | str | — | service principal, e.g. `HTTP/host.example.com` |
| `oidc_enabled` | bool | `false` | Federated SSO — OIDC auth-code + PKCE relying party ([ADR 0142](adr/0142-federated-sso-oidc-authorization-code-pkce-relying-party-hybrid-ad-backed.md)). A third login for an identity that **already exists in on-prem AD** (needs `ad_enabled`; roles come from LDAP, not the token). Off = byte-identical. Needs `[security].web_console_public_address` (the redirect origin). |
| `oidc_issuer` | str | — | https; exact-matched against the id_token `iss` |
| `oidc_client_id` | str | — | also the required `aud`/`azp` |
| `oidc_client_secret` | str | — | confidential-client secret — **env only** (`MEFOR_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`), never the file |
| `oidc_client_secret_ref` | str | — | alternative: a `[secrets].provider` reference (`_ref`, not `_secret`, to avoid `oidc_client_secret_secret`) |
| `oidc_authorization_endpoint` / `oidc_token_endpoint` / `oidc_jwks_uri` | str | — | https, **operator-pinned** (no `.well-known` discovery) |
| `oidc_allowed_endpoints` | list[str] | `[]` | defence-in-depth host allow-list; **refused empty when enabled**; every OIDC endpoint host must be listed |
| `oidc_tls_ca_cert_file` | str | — | the **engine's** back-channel TLS trust for the IdP (OpenSSL default trust ignores the Windows machine store) |
| `oidc_tls_ca_cert_pin` | str | — | optional lowercase-hex SHA-256 pin over the corresponding CA anchor PEM (`oidc_tls_ca_cert_file`); a mismatch refuses at load + reload (ASVS 6.7.1); unset = no pin (dormant) |
| `oidc_redirect_path` | str | `/ui/oidc/callback` | joined to `web_console_public_address` for the redirect URI |
| `oidc_scopes` | list[str] | `["openid","profile"]` | no `email`, no `offline_access` |
| `oidc_signing_algorithms` | list[str] | `["RS256"]` | coerced through the closed JWS algorithm enum |
| `oidc_username_claim` / `oidc_username_strip_domain` | str / bool | `preferred_username` / `true` | strip at `@` → sAMAccountName |
| `oidc_allowed_username_domains` | list[str] | `[]` | **the control that stops a federated principal choosing which on-prem account it resolves to.** `preferred_username` is neither unique nor stable (OIDC Core §5.7) and is operator- or even self-editable on many IdPs, so without this a guest presenting `Administrator@attacker.example` strips to `Administrator` and signs in as the on-prem Domain Admin. When `oidc_username_strip_domain` is on, the claim's UPN suffix **must** match one of these. Empty falls back to `ad_domain`; with neither set, `oidc_enabled` is **refused at load** rather than stripping unchecked. List the alternate UPN suffixes of a multi-domain forest here |
| `oidc_clock_skew_seconds` | int | `60` | wall-clock skew tolerance (0–300) |
| `oidc_require_mfa_claim` | bool | `true` | **#99(g) control** — refuse a token with no configured `amr`/`acr`. The engine verifies what the IdP **asserts**, not what it enforced |
| `oidc_mfa_amr_values` / `oidc_required_acr_values` | list[str] | `["mfa"]` / `[]` | either family satisfies the gate; both empty with the gate on is refused |
| `oidc_acr_values` / `oidc_prompt` | str | — | requested authorize params |
| `oidc_jwks_ttl_seconds` / `oidc_jwks_min_refetch_seconds` | int | `3600` / `300` | the JWKS cache TTL + the amplification (min-refetch) bound |
| `oidc_flow_ttl_seconds` / `oidc_flow_cache_max` | int | `300` / `512` | pending-flow TTL + the **reject-when-full** bound |
| `oidc_session_max_hours` | int | — | caps the federated session below `id_token.exp` if a tighter bound is wanted (ADR 0079 mechanism 1) |

> AD-group→role mappings live in the DB and are managed by an admin (`PUT /ad-group-map` or the

### `[ai]` — AI coding assistance policy
Implemented (see [AI.md](AI.md)). Controls the IDE AI assistant across the **OFF→PHI-safe** range;
the policy is centrally governed and **posture-clamped**. `mode`/`data_scope` plus the active
environment NAME + posture (`environment`/`data_class`/`production`) govern the policy; `provider`,
`model`, `endpoint`, `api_key` and `allowed_endpoints` are **live** under `mode = managed_endpoint` — the
engine broker ([ADR 0135](adr/0135-engine-brokered-ai-assistance-customer-managed-llm-egress-with-per-use-audit.md)).
Only `baa_attested` is still a forward-compat placeholder (accepted-but-ignored).
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | enum | `byo` | `off` · `byo` · `managed_endpoint` · `managed_claude` · `managed_claude_baa`. **`managed_endpoint` is built** — the engine brokers one `code_only` prompt to a customer-managed / self-hosted LLM over `POST /ai/chat`, audited per use (ADR 0135); it never reaches `phi` scope. `managed_claude`/`managed_claude_baa` are **future** — not serviceable by the current IDE |
| `data_scope` | enum | `code_only` | `code_only` · `synthetic` · `deidentified` · `phi`, least→most sensitive; capped by `production` posture and by `mode` (only `managed_claude_baa` reaches `phi`) |
| `environment` | str | — | free-form active-environment **name** (ADR 0017); selects `environments/<name>.toml` + `current_environment()`. **Required** for `serve` (no default) |
| `data_class` | | | **→ moved to `[security].handles_real_patient_data`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[ai]`. |
| `production` | | | **→ moved to `[security].production_instance`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[ai]`. |
| `provider` | str | `claude` | the broker's request shape; **read** under `mode = managed_endpoint` (and recorded in the per-use audit) |
| `model` | str | `claude-opus-4-8` | the model the broker asks for; **read** under `mode = managed_endpoint` (also echoed on the reply) |
| `baa_attested` | bool | `false` | **accepted-but-ignored** — an operator attestation carried for the future `managed_claude_baa` path |
| `endpoint` | str | — | the customer-managed LLM URL. **Required** for `mode = managed_endpoint`; `http`/`https` only, and a cleartext `http` endpoint is **refused** (it would expose `api_key`) |
| `api_key` | secret | — | the LLM credential — **env only** (`MEFOR_AI_API_KEY`), never the file. **Required** for `mode = managed_endpoint` |
| `allowed_endpoints` | list | `[]` | fail-closed SSRF allow-list for `endpoint`'s host; each entry is `host` (any port) or `host:port`. **An empty list permits nothing** — deliberately independent of `[egress].allowed_http`, which is permissive when empty and so can't gate this surface |

> Only `code_only` context is ever sent in the MVP (graph names + active editor code) — **never
> message bodies**. The full resolution/clamping algorithm, the `GET /ai/policy` endpoint, the
> `messagefoundry ai-policy` CLI, and the `ai:assist` RBAC permission are documented in
> [AI.md](AI.md). Env keys: `MEFOR_AI_MODE`, `MEFOR_AI_DATA_SCOPE`, `MEFOR_AI_ENVIRONMENT`, etc.

### `[logging]`
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `level` | enum | `info` | log level; never run prod at `debug` (PHI) — `serve` refuses it (Gate #1) |
| `format` | enum | `text` | stdout rendering: `text` (default) or structured `json` (one object per line). Stdlib only — no structlog |
| `log_dir` | str | _unset_ | the directory NSSM (or another supervisor) **rotates the engine's captured stdout/stderr into**. The engine never writes log **files** itself (it logs to stdout); set this only to tell it where the supervisor parks them, and `GET /status` then **meters that directory's total bytes + filesystem free space** alongside the DB metrics (#50). Unset = stdout-only, no metering. **Metadata only** — the file contents are never read. |
| `forward_enabled` | bool | _derived_ | ship a copy of every record off-box to a syslog/SIEM collector (sec-offbox-log) so evidence survives a host compromise. **Default-on-when-configured (ADR 0080):** unset ⇒ on iff `forward_host` is set. Set `false` to opt out even with a host; no `forward_host` ⇒ off (stdout-only, unchanged) |
| `forward_host` | str | — | syslog/SIEM collector host. Setting it turns forwarding on by default (above) |
| `forward_port` | int | `514` | collector port (1–65535) |
| `forward_protocol` | enum | `udp` | `udp` (fire-and-forget), `tcp`, or **`tls`** (RFC 5425 — native `ssl`-wrapped TCP, ADR 0080). A `tcp`/`tls` collector down at startup is skipped with a warning; a runtime stall is bounded by a socket timeout (record dropped) and the TLS handshake is bounded too, so a wedged collector never blocks the engine. Synchronous send — prefer `udp`/a local agent for high volume |
| `forward_format` | enum | `json` | wire format sent off-box, independent of stdout `format`. JSON guarantees one record per line; `text` framing is best-effort (multi-line tracebacks span lines) |
| `forward_tls_ca_file` | str | — | PEM trust anchor for the collector's cert (**required** when `forward_protocol = "tls"` and verification is on). Only this CA is trusted — the public system bundle is **not** loaded, so an on-prem SIEM's private cert is anchored explicitly |
| `forward_tls_verify` | bool | `true` | verify + hostname-check the collector's certificate. `false` is the documented **insecure** opt-out (`CERT_NONE`, no CA file needed) — lab / pinned-network only |
| `forward_tls_client_cert` | str | — | optional PEM cert+key chain for **mutual** TLS to the collector |
| `forward_hop_attested` | bool | `false` | **acknowledged opt-out** for a plaintext / unverified-TLS collector hop (#200, ADR 0092 — the `[logging]` sibling of a connection's `tls_hop_attested`). A hop that is not verified TLS is now decided by the shared posture gradient: **refused** on an enforcing PHI instance, warned on a non-enforcing PHI instance, allowed for loopback / synthetic. Set this (with a reason) to affirm the hop is secure by other means — e.g. a dedicated out-of-band management VLAN |
| `forward_hop_attested_reason` | str | — | why the hop is secure, recorded for the audit trail. **Mandatory when `forward_hop_attested = true`** (ADR 0153 retro-fitted the flag-implies-reason rule: an attestation that suppresses a refusal must record WHY, or it is worthless when audited) — the flag alone now fails at load. Rejected without the flag, and must be non-empty |
| `require_time_sync` | bool | `false` | **opt-in** startup clock-sync gate (ASVS 16.2.2, ADR 0080): before listeners start, probe `ntp_peer` and warn on skew. Requires `ntp_peer`. Default = no-op |
| `ntp_peer` | str | — | NTP/SNTP host to compare the local clock against (**required** when `require_time_sync`) |
| `time_sync_max_skew_seconds` | float | `2.0` | \|local − peer\| above this is "skewed" (must be > 0) |
| `time_sync_fail_closed` | bool | `false` | **refuse to start** (instead of warn) on skew or an unreachable peer. Further opt-in; requires `require_time_sync` |
| `file`, `max_bytes`, `backups` | str/int | — | **accepted-but-ignored** (planned) rotation — none is a `LoggingSettings` field. The engine logs to stdout and NSSM rotates it; `log_dir` above is how you point the engine at where it lands |

> PHI redaction + control-char scrubbing are **always-on handler filters** (not a toggle) applied to
> **every** sink, including the off-box forwarder. For an encrypted hop set `forward_protocol = "tls"`
> (native RFC 5425, no agent needed); alternatively front a plaintext `udp`/`tcp` forward with a local
> TLS-forwarding agent or a trusted network. See [PHI.md §7](PHI.md#7-logging--phi-redaction) and
> [ADR 0080](adr/0080-offbox-forwarding-tls-defaults.md).

> **The plaintext default is now gated, not silent (#200, ADR 0092).** The forwarded stream is
> PHI-redacted but still carries usernames, connection names, message ids, client addresses, and the
> tamper-evident audit chain. `serve` therefore decides the forwarding hop with the **same** authority
> the transports use, *before* the handler is installed: a hop that is not verified TLS is **refused**
> on an enforcing PHI instance, **warned** on a non-enforcing PHI one, and **allowed** for a loopback
> collector (so the "plaintext to `127.0.0.1` + a local agent" deployment is untouched) or a synthetic
> instance. To keep a plaintext off-box hop, either move to `forward_protocol = "tls"` or set
> `forward_hop_attested` with a reason — an acknowledged escape, not a silent default.

### `[retention]`
Enforced by the engine's retention/purge task ([pipeline/retention.py](../messagefoundry/pipeline/retention.py)).
A purge **NULLs the PHI *body*** past its window while **keeping the message row** (counts,
disposition, and the audit trail stay intact — the Mirth Data-Pruner pattern); it never deletes a
`messages` row and never touches a body still in flight. The *row* survives; its PHI *columns* do not
— `messages.metadata` is nulled in the same statement as the body (ASVS 14.2.7). The raw `[retention]` fields still default to
`0`/`""` = keep/off, **but `serve` applies a posture gate on top of them, so retention is *not*
opt-in on a PHI instance**: under `[security].enforcement = enforce` (the default) an unbounded
`[security].delete_message_bodies_after_days` or `[retention].dead_letter_days` **refuses to start
(exit 2)**; on a non-enforcing PHI instance each *unset* window is auto-bounded to **30 days**. All
three built-in environment names (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) derive PHI. The audited opt-out is
`[security].allow_keeping_phi_indefinitely = true`. See [PHI.md §8](PHI.md#8-retention--purge).
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `messages_days` | | | **→ moved to `[security].delete_message_bodies_after_days`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[retention]`. |
| `dead_letter_days` | int | `0` | past N days, null the bodies of **dead-lettered** outbound rows (their own window — a dead row stays replayable until purged). `0` = keep |
| `allow_unbounded_phi` | | | **→ moved to `[security].allow_keeping_phi_indefinitely`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[retention]`. |
| `state_max_age_days` | int | `0` | past N days, **delete** transform-state entries (ADR 0005) last written before the cutoff — keeps the in-memory state cache + table bounded. A simple global age purge (by `set_at`); per-namespace policy is a follow-up. `0` = keep |
| `connection_event_retention_hours` | int | `0` | past N **hours**, **delete** `connection_event` rows (the `[diagnostics]` #46 transport/lifecycle log — high-volume under a connect-per-message sender or a probe storm, so its own short window in **hours**, not days). `0` = inherit the `messages_days` body window (the ADR 0021 §7.5 default). |
| `app_log_days` | int | `0` | past N days, **delete** application **log files** (`.log`/`.txt`, one level) from the configured `[logging].log_dir` (#120). The supervisor (NSSM `AppRotateBytes`) rotates the daily logs by **size** but never by **age**, so the log dir grows unbounded; this bounds it (by file mtime, so the currently-written file is never eligible). `0` = keep. **No-op unless `[logging].log_dir` is set.** Metadata only — file content is never read. While `app_log_compress_days` is on, the same window also ages out the `*.log.gz`/`*.txt.gz` archives that setting produces — so compressing a log doesn't make it immortal; with compression off the eligible set is exactly what it was |
| `app_log_compress_days` | int | `0` | past N days, **gzip** application **log files** (`.log`/`.txt`, one level — the same selection as `app_log_days`, by mtime, so the currently-written file is never eligible) in `[logging].log_dir` to `<name>.gz` (#119). The log stays readable (`gzip -d`) at a fraction of the disk, so a long-running box keeps far more history for the same footprint. Each file is **free-space prechecked** (`shutil.disk_usage` must show room for the source **plus** its archive plus a `max(10%, 1 MiB)` margin — short, and the file is **skipped and logged**, never attempted) and each written archive is **integrity-validated** — staged to an **exclusively created, randomly named** temp file beside it (`tempfile.mkstemp`: `O_CREAT\|O_EXCL`, so it never truncates an existing file, never follows a symlink, and never collides with a sibling engine shard compressing the same directory), `fsync`ed, re-read **off disk**, decompressed and compared **byte-for-byte** against the original, renamed into place, and then **validated again at `<name>.gz` itself** — and it is that last check, on the bytes actually sitting where the log used to be, that authorizes removing the original. Any failure leaves the original **in place**, does not count it as compressed, and logs it; an existing `<name>.gz` is never clobbered. The archive inherits the source's mtime, so `app_log_days` still ages it out. Files over 64 MiB are skipped (the codec is in-memory), and so is a file whose archive would not be **smaller** than it (an empty or already-compressed log — compressing must never *cost* disk). Names/counts/sizes are logged, **never file content**. `0` = never compress. **No-op unless `[logging].log_dir` is set.** Set it **shorter** than `app_log_days` — a longer window compresses nothing, since the delete sweep runs first |
| `search_preset_days` | int | `0` | past N days, **delete** saved-search presets (ADR 0136) neither used nor edited since the cutoff. The stored `criteria` is the operator's own content/`field_value` needle — **PHI-shaped by construction**, encrypted at rest — so it needs a window like any other PHI tier (ASVS 14.2.7). The whole **row** is deleted, not blanked: a preset's entire payload *is* its criteria. **Keys on last-USED** (BACKLOG #306) — the cutoff is compared against the *later* of `updated_at` (written by a save) and `last_used_at` (written by a recall), so a preset you run daily but never re-save is **kept**. A preset last touched before the `last_used_at` column existed has it NULL and ages out on `updated_at` alone. `0` = keep forever (the default) |
| `audit_days` | int | `0` | **reserved / not enforced.** The `audit_log` is a tamper-evident hash chain and HIPAA expects ~6-year retention, so audit is **keep-forever by design**; archive-first pruning is a tracked follow-up. Accepted so a forward-looking file still loads |
| `max_db_mb` | int | `0` | advisory only: warn (WARNING log + an `AlertSink` `storage_threshold` event) when the database exceeds this — measured as the **SQLite file + `-wal`/`-shm`**, `SUM(size)` over `sys.database_files` on **SQL Server**, and `pg_database_size()` on **Postgres**. Never auto-deletes. `0` = off |
| `purge_interval_seconds` | float | `3600` | how often the purge/maintenance loop runs a pass |
| `max_pass_seconds` | float | `0` | maximum wall-clock seconds **one maintenance pass** may spend (#121, [ADR 0137](adr/0137-time-boxed-retention-maintenance-pass-between-phase-cap.md)). A **between-phase soft cap**: `run_once` checks elapsed monotonic time before each phase and, once this is reached, **skips the remaining phases** (marking the pass `capped`) so a long pass can't run unbounded into the next maintenance window — the skipped tail re-runs next interval, and a skipped WAL-checkpoint/VACUUM does **not** advance its last-run marker. Checked only *between* phases, never inside one, so a running VACUUM is non-interruptible. `0` = off (the default — no cap); ~`14400` (4 h, the Corepoint off-peak ceiling) is the recommended value when enabled |
| `wal_checkpoint_seconds` | float | `0` | `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` cadence — **SQLite only; a documented no-op on SQL Server and Postgres**, where log management is a DBA operation. `0` = off (rely on auto-checkpoint). Evaluated once per pass, so a value below `purge_interval_seconds` is effectively rounded up to it |
| `vacuum_at` | str | `""` | daily local `"HH:MM"` to run `VACUUM` (reclaims space freed by purges) — **SQLite only; a documented no-op on SQL Server and Postgres**, where space reclamation is a DBA operation. `""` = off. A daily off-peak time, **not** a cron expression (no new dependency); VACUUM holds a write lock on the whole DB while it runs |

> **Per-connection overrides ([ADR 0027](adr/0027-per-connection-retention.md)).** `messages_days` and
> `dead_letter_days` are **global defaults** an individual connection may override: an **inbound** sets its
> own `messages_days`, an **outbound** its own `dead_letter_days` (both `None` = inherit this global window,
> `0` = keep that connection's bodies forever, `>0` = days). An inbound may also opt into **embedded-document

### `[update_check]`
Engine-side version-update check ([ADR 0026](adr/0026-off-box-egress-update-check.md)). The MVP is a
**no-network "pinned-vs-current" diff**: it compares the running `messagefoundry.__version__` against the
version in the installed distribution metadata (`importlib.metadata`) / the bundled `requirements.lock` —
**zero outbound traffic**. The result is one additive `/status` field and (optionally) one `update_available`
AlertSink event that the console/IDE render as a dismissible banner — **the console/IDE never call PyPI**.
Because the local diff is cheap and PHI-safe it is **on by default** (zero phone-home risk).
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | emit the `/status` field + the `update_available` alert. `false` = suppress both |
| `check_interval_seconds` | float | `86400` | diff cadence (the diff is trivial; daily is ample). Must be `> 0` |
| `mode` | str | `"local"` | the no-network diff (the only MVP value). `"live"` (the constrained-egress path, ADR 0026 §2) is **defined but rejected at load**, so a config can never silently turn the check into a phone-home out of a PHI system |
| `index_url`, `index_allowed_hosts` | str / list | unset | forward-compat for the future `"live"` mode only — **accepted-but-unused** in the MVP |

### `[delivery]`
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `retry_max_attempts` | int | _unset_ | attempts before a delivery dead-letters. **Unset = retry forever** (the conservative default — a transient failure/`AE` NAK is never silently lost; under FIFO the head blocks its lane until it succeeds or is purged). Set a finite value to opt back into retry-then-dead-letter. A permanent `AR` reject fails fast regardless. |
| `retry_backoff_seconds`, `retry_backoff_multiplier`, `retry_max_backoff_seconds` | num | 5 / 2 / 300 | exponential backoff between attempts (per-outbound `retry=` overrides) |
| `ordering` | enum | `fifo` | default queue ordering per outbound: `fifo` (strict in-order, head-of-line on failure) or `unordered` (batch + rotate-past-failures). Per-outbound `ordering=` overrides. |
| `internal_error` | enum | `continue` | what a delivery worker does on an **internal/code error** (a non-`DeliveryError` exception from `send` — our bug, not the partner's): `continue` (dead-letter the row + advance) or `stop` (halt the connection's worker, preserve the message for replay, raise a `connection_stopped` alert). Per-outbound `internal_error=` overrides. Partner NAKs / transport failures are unaffected. |
| `buildup_max_depth` | int | _unset_ | raise a `queue_buildup` alert when an outbound lane's pending depth reaches this. Unset = depth dimension off (a healthy ceiling is throughput-specific, so there's no safe default). Per-outbound `buildup=BuildupThreshold(...)` overrides. |
| `buildup_max_oldest_seconds` | num | 300 | raise `queue_buildup` when the lane's **oldest** pending message has waited this long (a stuck/retry-forever head is the classic cause). On by default — a head stuck >5 min is a problem in any environment. Set to unset/`0`-disable via a per-outbound override. |
| `stall_max_oldest_seconds` | num | _unset_ | raise a `message_stall` alert (Corepoint "Max Message Stall", [ADR 0014](adr/0014-alerting-rules-engine.md)) when an outbound lane's **oldest undelivered message** has waited this long. **Unset (the default) = the stall alert is OFF** — deny-by-default/opt-in, because it overlaps `buildup_max_oldest_seconds`'s age dimension and would double-page if both fired. Set a threshold to turn it on; a per-outbound `stall=StallThreshold(...)` overrides it. The stall event routes through `[[alerts.rules]]` like any other ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-alerting-rules-engine.md)). |
| `saturation_sustain_samples` | int | _unset_ | raise a `saturation` alert (BACKLOG #93, [ADR 0014 amendment](adr/0014-alerting-rules-engine.md)) when an outbound lane's pending backlog is **rising sustained** over this many consecutive samples — the queue **derivative** (ingest > drain), distinct from the absolute depth/age ceilings above. A bursty-but-**draining** lane (spike then fall) never fires; only a lane whose depth climbs monotonically does. **Unset (the default) = OFF** — deny-by-default/opt-in (it overlaps `buildup_max_oldest_seconds`'s age dimension). Floor of 2 (fewer can't tell a burst from sustained growth). Global-only for now; a per-outbound override is a documented follow-up (a `[[alerts.rules]]` `connection` glob with `transports = []` can suppress it for a known-bursty feed in the interim). |
| `priority` | enum | `normal` | **global DR / priority tier default** for every connection (#61, [ADR 0048](adr/0048-third-tier-disaster-recovery-standby.md)). A connection declaring no `priority=` of its own inherits this; resolution order is per-connection override > this global default > the built-in `normal`. The total order is `critical > normal > low`, and the [`[dr]`](#dr--third-tier-disaster-recovery-standby) run-profile starts only connections whose resolved rank is at or above `[dr].priority_threshold`. It governs **when a connection runs**, never what it does. `normal` keeps every connection at the same tier, so a deployment that never enables DR is byte-unchanged. An unknown value fails config load. |
| `outbox_workers` | int | — | **accepted-but-ignored** (planned): delivery concurrency. Not a `DeliverySettings` field — worker topology is set by `[pipeline].claim_mode` today |
| `dead_letter` | enum | — | **accepted-but-ignored** (planned): `keep`/`drop`-after-N. Not a `DeliverySettings` field — a finite `retry_max_attempts` is what dead-letters a row today |

### `[pipeline]`
| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_correlation_depth` | int (≥1) | 8 | **Re-ingress loop cap** (ADR 0013 Increment 2). When a captured reply is re-ingressed (`reingress_to=`/`Loopback()`), the re-ingressed message carries a `correlation_depth`; a message at this depth still routes, but the next hop (depth+1) **dead-letters** its re-ingress work-row and marks the origin `ERROR`. Coarse by design — it bounds *total work*, not topology, so a chain that legitimately bounces A→B→A a few times needs headroom. 8 is safe for typical request→response→route feeds; raise it for deep correlation chains, lower it to fence a misbehaving loop. (A value of 0 would dead-letter every re-ingress, so the floor is 1.) |
| `per_lane_wake` | bool | `false` | **Per-lane wake events** (B12, [ADR 0061](adr/0061-per-lane-wake-events.md)). **Reliability-core, default-OFF.** When `false`, a committed message wakes every worker of its stage via an engine-wide event (the historical behavior). When `true`, it wakes **only its own (stage, lane) worker**, eliminating the thundering-herd empty-claim storm that dominates at high **connection** counts (~1,500 inbounds). Correctness is unchanged (the FIFO claim + the 0.25 s lost-wakeup poll backstop are untouched; a missed wake self-heals within the poll). **Read once at engine start — a `/config/reload` does NOT toggle it (restart to change).** Env override (for the connection-scale harness A/B): `MEFOR_PIPELINE_PER_LANE_WAKE=true`. Applies only in `per_lane` claim mode (see `claim_mode`); the default `pooled` mode routes wakes through its dispatchers instead, so this knob is inert there. |
| `claim_mode` | enum | `pooled` | **Pipeline claim mode** ([ADR 0066](adr/0066-pooled-stage-claimers.md)). **Reliability-core.** `pooled` (the **default since #744**) runs one `StageDispatcher` per stage — a handful of shared claimer tasks batch-claim head-prefixes across lanes, collapsing the per-connection claim storm and holding zero-loss at high fan-out where `per_lane` drops messages. `per_lane` is the **byte-identical opt-out** (`[pipeline].claim_mode = "per_lane"`): the pre-ADR-0066 topology of one router+transform worker per inbound and one delivery worker per outbound, enforced by a test sentinel. **Read once at engine start — a `/config/reload` does NOT toggle it (restart to change).** Env override (harness A/B): `MEFOR_PIPELINE_CLAIM_MODE`. **Two caveats** (see [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md) "Pipeline claim mode"): exactly-once degrades under load (no inbound de-dup — receivers must be idempotent; not pooled-specific) and active-passive failover-under-load is covered (the gated `test_load_failover_{postgres,sqlserver}` two-node kill-the-leader runs hold no-acknowledged-loss / per-lane FIFO / bounded dup-rate under pooled; only recovery *time* is host-dependent, and the T17 infra-fault spin is bounded by ADR 0070). Invariants (at-least-once / per-lane FIFO / poison-guard) are unchanged in both modes. |
| `pooled_claimers_per_stage` | int (≥1) | 1 | Pooled-only: K claimer tasks per stage (`>1` hash-partitions lanes across claimers so no two claim the same lane). |
| `pooled_sweep_interval` | float (>0) | 0.25 | Pooled-only: the clock-driven discovery-sweep interval (the bounded at-least-once backstop; 0.25 s = `poll_interval` parity). |
| `pooled_claim_lane_chunk` | int (1–500) | 256 | Pooled-only: max lanes batch-claimed per claim round-trip (clamped down to the backend store's chunk — SQLite 200, SS/PG 500). |
| `pooled_max_processing_lanes` | int (≥1) | 256 | Pooled-only: max concurrently-processing lanes per stage (the decrypted-body / crash-exposure bound). |
| `require_rcsi_for_pooled` | bool | `true` | Pooled-only (SQL Server): fail closed at startup if `READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT` is OFF (the §3.2 correctness proofs assume RCSI on); `false` downgrades to a loud warning + a `/stats` `rcsi_off_degraded` gauge. No-op on SQLite/Postgres. |
| `infra_fault_policy` | enum | `stop` | **Pooled T17 (infra/machinery-fault) handling** ([ADR 0070](adr/0070-t17-infra-fault-bound.md)). A store/handoff error — or any raise from **outside** the per-item body — is caught by the dispatcher's T17 handler, which always re-pends the faulting head at an exponential-capped backoff (collapsing the ~4×/s sweep spin). This key bounds a **persistent** such fault: `stop` (default) STOPs the head-of-line-blocked lane after `infra_fault_stop_after` consecutive zero-progress faults, reusing the `internal_error = stop` muscle (STOPPED phase + `connection_stopped` alert; reload / new work re-arms) and **never** dead-lettering the good message. `retry_forever` never STOPs — it retries the head at capped backoff forever and emits a throttled `lane_stuck` alert once the horizon is crossed (for a deliberately-unattended flaky-infra site). Reliability-core: **read once at engine construction — a `/config/reload` does NOT re-read it (restart to change).** |
| `infra_fault_stop_after` | int (≥1) | 10 | consecutive zero-progress T17 faults before a `stop`-policy lane transitions to STOPPED — and the stuck horizon at which `retry_forever`'s throttled `lane_stuck` alert first fires. Under the exponential backoff (capped by `infra_fault_backoff_cap`) 10 spans ~4 min of wall clock, so it is really a duration gate. |
| `infra_fault_backoff_cap` | float (>0) | 60.0 | cap (seconds) on the T17 head re-pend backoff — base is the dispatcher's 1 s lane-error backoff, doubling per consecutive zero-progress fault. ~60 s picks a recovered dependency back up within about a minute while still collapsing the spin. |
| `fuse_thread_hops` | bool | `false` | **Thread-hop fusion** ([ADR 0071](adr/0071-cut-executor-round-trips-b5.md) B5). **Reliability-core, default-OFF, SQL-Server-scoped:** when `true` **and** the store backend is SQL Server **and** `claim_mode = "pooled"`, each fused stage (INGRESS/ROUTED) runs its off-loop CPU stage (`route_only`/`transform_one`) together with its store handoff on a **single** dedicated-executor worker hop, collapsing a multi-statement aioodbc handoff into one executor→loop completion (the profiled per-completion async-marshaling wall). Provably no-op elsewhere: Postgres (asyncpg is loop-native) and SQLite (loop-affine handoff lock) keep the async path by construction and log "ignored", and a sync-handoff-pool open failure downgrades to the async path with a loud warning + a degraded gauge — never a lane outage. **Read once at engine construction (restart to change).** Env/harness A/B: `MEFOR_PIPELINE_FUSE_THREAD_HOPS`. |
| `pooled_fusing_workers` | int (≥1) | 8 | worker count for **each** per-stage fusing executor (ADR 0071 B5). Every fused stage gets its own `ThreadPoolExecutor` of this width plus a matching-width dedicated synchronous pyodbc handoff pool (one connection per worker, so a fused hop never blocks acquiring). Small by default — a fused hop holds a worker across DB latency, so this *is* the fused-stage concurrency; it also clamps the fused stages' effective `pooled_max_processing_lanes` to ~2× this value, so the claimer doesn't reserve 256 slots for a handful of workers. Inert unless `fuse_thread_hops` is on. |
| `batch_handoff_statements` | bool | `true` | **Per-hop SQL statement batching** ([ADR 0075](adr/0075-per-hop-sql-statement-batching.md)). **Default-ON** (promoted 2026-07-08; retained as an emergency off-switch) and SQL-Server-scoped: each per-hop staged handoff (`route_handoff` / `transform_handoff`) folds the non-result-returning DML of its body into the fewest `pyodbc.execute()` T-SQL batches — the same ordered `(sql, params)` sequence, one round-trip per batch, still committing **exactly once per hop**. It cuts network round-trips, **not** transactions: no commit boundary moves, the claim stays its own poison-guard transaction, and the ACK-on-receipt fence is untouched. Each result-consuming statement whose value gates later control flow (the guard `DELETE`, the finalize `GROUP BY`, the finalize `sp_getapplock` rc-check) stays its own execute. Postgres and SQLite have no batched path and run byte-identically. **Read once at engine construction (restart to change).** Env: `MEFOR_PIPELINE_BATCH_HANDOFF_STATEMENTS`. |
| `snapshot_on_send` | bool | `true` | **Copy-on-`Send`** ([ADR 0104](adr/0104-copy-on-send-outbound-message-model-recognition-first-handler-message-type-and-hl7-field-picker.md)) — snapshot each `Send`'s payload at construction so a **divergent fan-out** (mutate between `Send`s) delivers per-destination state instead of a last-write collapse. **Default-ON** since the BACKLOG #230 default-flip: the conservative estate AST scan flagged 1 of 152 handlers and human triage found that one mutates an independent clone, so genuine divergence is **0** and the flip changes delivered bytes for no handler; and `Message.copy()` is now genuine copy-on-write, so the common single-`Send` / no-post-mutation path is zero-copy and a deepcopy fires only on an actual divergence. Set `false` to restore the pre-ADR-0104 last-write behaviour. Backend-agnostic. **Read once at engine construction (restart to change).** Env: `MEFOR_PIPELINE_SNAPSHOT_ON_SEND`. |
| `credential_fault_policy` | enum | `stop` | **Partner-account-lockout protection** (#109, [ADR 0095](adr/0095-connection-lifecycle-scheduler-and-credential-fault-stop.md)). What an outbound File/FTP/SFTP sender does on a **permanent credential/auth fault** (bad password, key rejected). `stop` (default) halts the lane **immediately** (not after a streak) and **retains the queued rows un-errored** (they stay pending/claimable, never dead-lettered), so a backlog can't re-authenticate in a loop and trip the partner's account lockout — reusing the STOP muscle (`connection_stopped` alert; reload/restart re-arms the lane once the credential is fixed). `dead_letter` keeps the historical fail-fast (dead-letter just the offending row and advance). A **content**-permanent reject (AR/CR, no-such-dir) is unaffected — it still dead-letters. |
| `schedule_tick_seconds` | float (>0) | 30.0 | **Active-window scheduler tick** (#147, [ADR 0095](adr/0095-connection-lifecycle-scheduler-and-credential-fault-stop.md)). The reconcile granularity for a connection's per-connection `schedule` (a window boundary is honoured within one tick). Only affects connections that declare a `schedule`; connections with none are byte-identical always-on. |

### `[sandbox]`
**Opt-in subprocess isolation for Routers/Handlers** ([ADR 0087](adr/0087-sandbox-subprocess-isolation.md),
BACKLOG #197, ASVS 15.2.5). Routers/Handlers are admin-authored pure Python the engine runs in its own
address space (the DEK, audit chain, and live sockets live there). `mode="off"` (the default) runs them
in-process, **byte-identically and with zero overhead**. `mode="subprocess"` runs each inbound's
Router/Handler in a **persistent per-inbound worker child** (never a per-message fork), enforcing a
forbidden-import guard (socket/store/crypto), the resource caps below, and a **fail-closed** refusal of
the live `db_lookup`/`fhir_lookup` bridges (they re-enter the event loop — a subprocess boundary breaks
that; a Handler needing live enrichment runs with `mode=off`). An isolation denial (forbidden op, cap
overrun, worker crash) routes the message to `ERROR`/dead-letter **post-ACK** (no NAK, never dropped).
**Read once at engine start — a `/config/reload` does NOT re-read it (restart to change).**

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | enum | `off` | `off` (in-process, byte-identical, no subprocess) or `subprocess` (persistent per-inbound worker child). |
| `wall_seconds` | float (>0) | 5.0 | **Authoritative** wall-clock cap per Router/Handler call on **every** platform — the parent kills a worker that overruns it, so a pathological busy-loop can't wedge intake. |
| `cpu_seconds` | float (>0) | 2.0 | POSIX-only `RLIMIT_CPU` backstop inside the child (a no-op on Windows, where `wall_seconds` governs). |
| `mem_mb` | int (≥1) or null | 512 | POSIX-only `RLIMIT_AS` address-space cap (MiB) inside the child (no-op on Windows). `null` disables it. |
| `startup_seconds` | float (>0) | 30.0 | Bound on the one-time child bootstrap (config load + guard install) before start fails closed. |

### `[diagnostics]`
The Corepoint-style **event log** (#46) — a metadata-only record of connection lifecycle / pre-ingress
failures and the ACK/NAK the engine returns. **Both master switches are on by default and safe to be:**
they store only non-PHI metadata (connection name, peer IP, a scrubbed reason, the ACK disposition), and
the AA-ACK *body* is stored only when the store is encrypted (else NULL); a NAK body is never persisted.
A per-connection `capture_connection_errors` / `capture_ack` flag overrides the matching master switch for
one connection (see [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md)). `message_events`, the third row below, is **not** a
master switch but a **verbosity dial** over the per-message disposition log — it defaults to `all` and
keeps a compliance floor even at `off`. The fourth row is a relocated key, rejected here since ADR 0118.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `connection_events` | bool | `true` | master switch for the **connection/transport event log**: inbound lifecycle (established/closed) + pre-ingress failures (allowlist/capacity/oversize/peer-reset/framing) + outbound lane transitions (connection_lost/restored). Metadata-only, written off the hot path by a drain task. Per-connection `capture_connection_errors` overrides it. |
| `response_sent` | bool | `true` | master switch for **"Response Sent"** — the ACK/NAK returned to an inbound sender. Always captures the disposition metadata (`ack_code`/`phase`/`outcome`); the AA body is stored only on an encrypted store, and every NAK body is NULL. Per-connection `capture_ack` overrides it. |
| `message_events` | enum | `all` | verbosity of the per-message **`message_events`** disposition log (#63) — how many rows the store writes to that table. `all` (default) records every event; `errors` drops the routine successes (`received`/`delivered`/`replayed`); `off` keeps only the floor. **A compliance floor is retained at every level, even `off`:** `viewed` (the HIPAA PHI-access trail) plus the terminal `dead`/`error`/`failed`. Not a master switch — it never touches the `messages`/queue disposition rows (count-and-log is separate) or the tamper-evident `audit_log` chain. |

### `[egress]`
Fail-closed **outbound destination allowlist** (WP-11c; ASVS 13.2.4/13.2.5/14.2.3) — bounds where the
engine may **send** PHI, so a fat-fingered or hostile destination can't exfiltrate it. Each list is
**opt-in**: empty = unrestricted (today's behavior); once a transport's list is set, an outbound of
that transport not on it is **refused at config load/reload** (a `WiringError` → 422 / refused reload),
checked against the resolved (`env()`-substituted) destination.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `allowed_mllp` | list | `[]` | allowed MLLP destinations; each entry is `host` (any port) or `host:port`. Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_EGRESS_ALLOWED_MLLP` |
| `allowed_tcp` | list | `[]` | allowed raw-TCP (`Tcp(...)`) destinations; each entry is `host` (any port) or `host:port`. An inbound `Tcp(...)` is a local listener and is not gated. Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_EGRESS_ALLOWED_TCP` |
| `allowed_file_dirs` | list | `[]` | allowed File output directories; a destination's directory must resolve at/under one of these |
| `allowed_http` | list | `[]` | allowed REST/SOAP (HTTP) destination hosts; each entry is `host` (any port) or `host:port` (ADR 0003). Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_EGRESS_ALLOWED_HTTP` |
| `allowed_db` | list | `[]` | allowed DATABASE destination servers; each entry is `host` (any port) or `host:port` (ADR 0003). Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_EGRESS_ALLOWED_DB` |
| `allowed_remote` | list | `[]` | allowed RemoteFile (SFTP/FTP/FTPS) hosts — gates the connector in **both** directions (source poll + destination upload); each entry is `host` (any port) or `host:port`. Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_EGRESS_ALLOWED_REMOTE` |
| `allowed_smtp` | list | `[]` | allowed **email (SMTP)** destination hosts for the `Email(...)` outbound ([ADR 0029](adr/0029-email-smtp-destination.md)); each entry is `host` (any port) or `host:port`. Distinct from `[alerts].smtp_allowed_hosts`, which gates the **alert notifier's** own SMTP dial. Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_EGRESS_ALLOWED_SMTP` |
| `allowed_direct` | list | `[]` | allowed **Direct** (S/MIME-over-SMTP HISP relay) destination hosts ([ADR 0085](adr/0085-direct-hisp-smime-connector.md)); each entry is `host` (any port) or `host:port`. Kept deliberately **separate from `allowed_smtp`** so an operator can permit a Direct HISP relay without opening generic email egress — a distinct trust relationship carrying encrypted PHI. Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_EGRESS_ALLOWED_DIRECT` |
| `proxy_url` | str | _unset_ | site-wide **default forward/egress web proxy** for the HTTP family — REST/SOAP/FHIR/`fhir_lookup`/DICOMweb plus the OAuth2/SMART token endpoints ([ADR 0126](adr/0126-outbound-forward-egress-web-proxy-for-the-stdlib-http-family.md)). A connection that sets no per-connection `proxy` inherits this; a per-connection value overrides it. Unset (default) = no site-wide proxy (byte-identical — only per-connection proxies apply). `"default"` selects the OS default web proxy (`getproxies()`); an `http(s)://` address names an explicit one. **Proxy credentials stay per-connection** (secrets via `env()`), never a global TOML value. Via env: `MEFOR_EGRESS_PROXY_URL` |
| `proxy_no_proxy` | list | `[]` | the site-wide `NO_PROXY`-style **bypass list** inherited by a connection that sets no per-connection `proxy_no_proxy`. Each entry is a host, `.suffix`, `*.suffix` or `*`. Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_EGRESS_PROXY_NO_PROXY` |
| `deny_by_default` | | | **→ moved to `[security].block_unlisted_outbound`** (ADR 0118) — set it there; no longer accepted in `[egress]`. |
| `fhir_require_structured_params` | bool | `false` | when `true`, a `fhir_lookup` search must use the structured `params=` form (each value percent-encoded); the flat author-encoded `?`-query is refused before it dials out (ASVS 1.2.2, [ADR 0043](adr/0043-fhir-read-lookup.md)). A read-by-id and the `params=` form are unaffected. Default `false` keeps the flat form (byte-identical). Via env: `MEFOR_EGRESS_FHIR_REQUIRE_STRUCTURED_PARAMS` |

> **FHIR-read query hardening (ASVS 1.2.2).** For a Pass posture set `[egress].fhir_require_structured_params = true`
> so every `fhir_lookup` search is forced through the per-value-encoded `params=` form and the flat `?`-query
> escape hatch (which relies on the Handler author to encode each value) can no longer smuggle an extra FHIR
> search parameter. Default-off keeps the flat form for back-compat, which leaves the query-encoding an author
> responsibility — the structured form is the safe path either way.

> `serve` warns at startup in a `prod`/`staging` environment when egress is fully open (no allowlist set
> **and** `deny_by_default` off) — a transform could then send PHI anywhere. Lock it down with
> `deny_by_default = true` or the per-transport lists above.

> The webhook/SMTP **alert** sinks carry no message bodies (no PHI) and keep their own host allowlists
> in `[alerts]` (`webhook_allowed_hosts` / `smtp_allowed_hosts`).

> **Cleartext (`http://`) egress is refused, whatever the data label (ASVS 12.2.1,
> [ADR 0153](adr/0153-collapse-the-posture-gradient-no-data-label-may-allow-a-cleartext-hop.md)).**
> Separately from this allowlist, a plaintext `http://` outbound to a **non-loopback** host is decided by
> [`config/tls_policy.py`](../messagefoundry/config/tls_policy.py)'s `insecure_hop_disposition`, enforced

> ([`transports/rest.py`](../messagefoundry/transports/rest.py)). The precedence is: a loopback / on-box
> hop is **allowed**; a per-connection `tls_hop_attested` hop is **allowed** (the operator asserts it is
> secure by other means); a per-connection `cleartext_accepted` hop is **crossed with a loud, audited
> WARN** (the operator accepts that it is not secure); a non-enforcing instance
> (`[security].enforcement = warn`) **warns**; everything else is **refused** (fail-closed).
> **`data_class` is no longer read here** — a `synthetic` label used to allow every cleartext hop
> silently, which made a typo in one file indistinguishable from a deliberate declaration, with every
> transport hop in the product as its blast radius. `MEFOR_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS` no longer influences this
> decision either; it survives for the non-connection cells that have nowhere to carry a declaration.

### `[shadow]`
Parallel-run / **shadow-instance** egress suppression (#15). A *shadow* MessageFoundry processes real
(teed) traffic to validate it against a legacy engine, but must **not** deliver to live partners (the
legacy engine is still the real sender). An outbound in **simulate** mode runs the full pipeline +
count-and-log and finalizes the message **`PROCESSED`**, but **suppresses the real egress** (no
bytes/SQL leave the box) and retains the would-send payload for parity comparison.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `simulate_all_egress` | bool | `false` | **deployment-wide master switch**: when `true`, **every** outbound runs egress-suppressed regardless of its own `simulate=` — so a shadow stand-up can't accidentally leave one outbound live. Default `false` = each outbound's own `simulate=` flag applies. |

> Per-outbound control is the precise mechanism — set `simulate = true` on an individual outbound
> (`outbound(..., simulate=True)` or `simulate = true` in `connections.toml`); this section is the blunt
> instance-wide override. A simulated lane is surfaced as `simulated` on `GET /connections` and shown as
> `[SIMULATED]` in the console. Simulate suppresses **egress only** — the `[egress]` allowlist, connector
> construction, and handler state writes are unaffected. With egress suppressed there is no real partner
> reply, so a **capturing / `reingress_to`** outbound captures (and re-ingresses) **nothing** in simulate —
> the message just finalizes `PROCESSED`.

> **Simulate is not "not deployed."** A simulated outbound is **fully wired** — its connector is built, its
> `env()` values are resolved, it receives rows, and it finalizes `PROCESSED`; it just suppresses the bytes
> on the wire. A **not-deployed** connection (`deployed=false`, [ADR 0111](adr/0111-not-deployed-connections.md))
> is the opposite: it is never built, its `env()` is never resolved, and a `Send` to it is recorded-and-dropped,
> not delivered-to-nothing. Use *simulate* for parallel-run; use *not deployed* for a feed that exists in config
> but is deliberately dark. See [CONNECTIONS.md → Connection lifecycle](CONNECTIONS.md#connection-lifecycle--deployed--auto_start).

### `[alerts]`
Where the delivery pipeline's operational alerts (e.g. `connection_stopped`, `queue_buildup`,
`connection_error`, `message_stall`, `integrity_drift`) are
delivered. **Both transports are off by default** — with neither configured, events are logged at
`WARNING` (the `LoggingAlertSink`). A transport turns on when its essentials are present. Payloads
carry the connection name + queue shape only — **never a message body** (no PHI). Delivery is
best-effort and runs on a background task, so it never blocks or hangs a delivery lane.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `webhook_url` | str | _unset_ | enable the **webhook** transport: HTTP `POST` the event as JSON here (fronts Slack/Teams/PagerDuty/custom inbound webhooks). |
| `webhook_timeout` | num | 10 | seconds per POST |
| `webhook_allowed_hosts` | list | `[]` | egress allowlist for the webhook host (`[]` = any); SSRF defense (ASVS 15.3.2/1.3.6) |
| `email_smtp_host` | str | _unset_ | SMTP server; with `email_from` + `email_to` set, enables the **email** transport |
| `email_smtp_port` | int | 587 | SMTP port |
| `email_from` | str | _unset_ | sender address (required for email) |
| `email_to` | list | _unset_ | recipient(s) (required for email). Via env: comma-separated `MEFOR_ALERTS_EMAIL_TO` |
| `email_use_tls` | bool | `true` | issue STARTTLS before sending |
| `email_username` | str | _unset_ | SMTP login user (omit for unauthenticated relays) |
| `email_password` | str | _unset_ | **secret** — supply via `MEFOR_ALERTS_EMAIL_PASSWORD`, never the file (or use `email_password_secret`) |
| `email_password_secret` | str | _unset_ | connector `SecretProvider` reference (ADR 0019 §5) — when set and `[secrets].provider` is configured, the SMTP password is resolved from that backend (e.g. a Vault KV `path#field`) instead of `email_password`. A reference, not a secret. |
| `email_timeout` | num | 30 | seconds per send |
| `smtp_allowed_hosts` | list | `[]` | egress allowlist for the SMTP host (`[]` = any); parity with `webhook_allowed_hosts` (WP-11c) |
| `email_subject_template` | str | _unset_ | optional **operator-editable** alert-email subject (#138, [ADR 0127](adr/0127-operator-editable-alert-email-templates-with-a-non-phi-variable-allowlist.md)). Unset (the default, with its two siblings) = the fixed subject + key/value body, byte-identical to before. When set it is a `{name}` template over a **closed non-PHI variable allow-list**, validated at config load and **fail-closed** — an unknown or message-derived reference raises rather than rendering |
| `email_body_template` | str | _unset_ | the same, for the **plain-text** body. The plain-text part is **always** sent, even when an HTML alternative is configured |
| `email_html_template` | str | _unset_ | the same, adding an **HTML alternative** part whose substituted *values* are HTML-escaped. Never HTML-only — it supplements `email_body_template`, it does not replace it |
| `security_notifications_required` | bool | `true` | **secure-by-default gate (BACKLOG #188, ASVS 6.3.5/6.3.7).** On a **PHI** instance, if no effective out-of-band security-notification channel is configured — `[auth].notify_security_events` on **and** `email_smtp_host` + `email_from` set — `serve` **refuses to start in production** and **warns** in a non-production PHI env. Set `false` to accept the pull-only `GET /me/security-events` feed instead (audited). |
| `realert_seconds` | num | 300 | suppress re-notifying the same (event, connection) more often than this (anti-spam for a flapping lane). A matching rule's `cooldown_seconds` overrides it. |
| `rules` | list | `[]` | ordered `[[alerts.rules]]` table array — per-event severity, transport routing, thresholds, suppression, cooldown (see below). Empty = today's behaviour (every event → every transport at `warning`). |

#### `[[alerts.rules]]` — per-event routing (ADR 0014)
Each rule is a row in an **ordered** `[[alerts.rules]]` array; the **first matching rule wins** (so
put the most specific rules first). An event matching **no** rule keeps the default: notify **every**
configured transport at `warning` with the global `realert_seconds` — so adding a rule never silently
silences an event you didn't name. Matching is pure config (no code/`eval`).

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event_type` | str | `any` | match this event: `any`, `connection_stopped`, `queue_buildup`, `storage_threshold`, `cert_expiry`, `connection_error`, `message_stall`, `integrity_drift`, or `gcm_invocations` |
| `connection` | str (glob) | `*` | glob over the connection name (e.g. `OB_*`, `IB_ACME_*`) |
| `min_depth` | int | _unset_ | `queue_buildup` only — match only when pending depth is at/over this |
| `min_oldest_seconds` | num | _unset_ | `queue_buildup` only — …or the oldest pending message has waited at least this long |
| `severity` | str | `warning` | `info` \| `warning` \| `critical` — tagged onto the event (webhook JSON + email subject) for downstream triage |
| `transports` | list | _all_ | which transports fire: subset of `["webhook", "email"]`; **unset = all configured**; **`[]` = SUPPRESS** (drop silently) |
| `cooldown_seconds` | num | _global_ | override `realert_seconds` for matching events (e.g. re-page a critical sooner) |

```toml
[alerts]
webhook_url = "https://hooks.example.com/services/XXX"   # webhook transport on

```

> A rule routing to a transport that isn't configured (e.g. `transports = ["email"]` with no SMTP

> the payload; **timed multi-stage escalation** ("email now, page in 15 min") is future work (ADR 0014
> §3) — rules give the static routing primitive it would build on.

### `[cert_monitor]`
Periodic TLS-certificate **expiry monitor**. Now that native off-loopback TLS is the supported posture
([`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md)), a silently expiring certificate is a hard PHI-feed outage at renewal
time. The engine scans the certs it actually serves with — the `[api].tls_cert_file` and every
connection's `tls_cert_file` (MLLP server/client identity) — and raises a **`cert_expiry`** alert (an
[`[alerts]`](#alerts) event — route it with a `[[alerts.rules]]` rule) when one is expired or within
`warn_days` of expiry. Only the **public certificate** is read (its `notAfter`), never a private key.
On by default with a 30-day window; set `warn_days = 0` to disable.

**Service-caller (inbound mTLS) certs — ASVS 6.4.5.** A cert an inbound *caller* presents is one the
engine only **verifies**, never serves, so the scan above cannot see it. Two arms cover it: the
cert-identity resolver checks the `notAfter` of each verified, allow-listed client cert **at the mTLS
handshake** and raises the same `cert_expiry` alert when it is inside `warn_days` (throttled per cert at
the `check_interval_seconds` cadence, since that path runs per request); and
[`[api].tls_client_cert_files`](#api) lets you list caller certs you hold copies of, so they are scanned
like any other file. The file list is what covers a caller whose cert expires **while it has stopped
connecting** — a handshake can only reveal a cert that is still being presented.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `warn_days` | int | 30 | alert when a served cert expires within this many days; **`0` disables** the monitor |
| `check_interval_seconds` | num | 43200 | rescan cadence (default 12h); the per-cert re-alert throttle is `[alerts].realert_seconds` |

```toml
[cert_monitor]
warn_days = 45            # start warning 45 days out

# Page (don't just email) when a served cert is close to expiry.
[[alerts.rules]]
event_type = "cert_expiry"
severity = "critical"
transports = ["webhook"]
```

### `[secrets]` — connector `SecretProvider` selection
Selects **how a named connector credential is sourced** ([ADR 0019](adr/0019-pluggable-keyprovider-hsm-kms-vault.md)
§5) — from an external secrets backend **instead of** a `MEFOR_*` env var. The connector-secret twin of
[`[store].key_provider`](#store) (which sources the store DEK).

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provider` | str | `none` | `none` \| `env` \| `vault`. **`none` (default) consults no provider — every credential stays env-sourced (byte-identical).** `env` resolves a reference as an env-var name; `vault` reads **Vault KV v2** behind the lazy `[vault]` / `hvac` extra (the **same** dependency the store's Vault `key_provider` uses — no new dep). Names a *provider*, not a secret. |

A provider is consulted **only** for a credential whose per-credential `*_secret` reference is set — today
`[auth].ad_bind_password_secret` and `[alerts].email_password_secret` (the wired points); the SQL Server
store password is seam-only (managed identity is preferred there). A reference is `"<kv-path>"` or
`"<kv-path>#<field>"` for `vault` (field defaults to `value`; KV mount from `MEFOR_SECRETS_VAULT_KV_MOUNT`,
default `secret`); Vault address/token come from `MEFOR_SECRETS_VAULT_ADDR` / `MEFOR_SECRETS_VAULT_TOKEN`
(falling back to hvac's `VAULT_ADDR` / `VAULT_TOKEN`). **Fail-closed:** a reference with `provider = none`,
an unknown provider, a missing `[vault]` extra, or an unresolvable/empty secret raises at load/connect —
never a blank credential; the value is never logged.

### `[secret_rotation]`
Periodic **secret-rotation reminder** ([ADR 0019](adr/0019-pluggable-keyprovider-hsm-kms-vault.md) §5.1) —
the secret-side twin of [`[cert_monitor]`](#cert_monitor). A TLS cert carries its own expiry, but a
long-lived secret (the **store data-encryption key** today; connector credentials in a future
`SecretProvider`) has none, so a stale key can sit unrotated with no in-engine signal. The engine
periodically compares each tracked secret's operator-recorded **last-rotated date** against its **max
age** and raises a **`secret_rotation_due`** alert (an [`[alerts]`](#alerts) event — route it with a
`[[alerts.rules]]` rule) when it is overdue or within `warn_days` of due. It reads only the rotation
**dates** you configure here — **never any secret value** (PHI-free). This is a *reminder*, not
enforcement: it never rotates a key or blocks startup (run `rotate-key` to rotate the store DEK). Under
`[security].enforcement = enforce`, a store DEK past `store_key_max_age_days + enforce_grace_days`
escalates its alert at restart (`enforced = true`) — still an alert, never a refusal.

The store DEK is tracked **live-by-default** (ASVS 13.3.4): at first keyed start the engine records a
non-secret tracked-since stamp (the DEK key-id + first-seen date) in store meta and watches the DEK off
it, so `store_key_last_rotated` is an **override**, not a prerequisite. The connector/AD/SMTP/Vault/OIDC
credentials the engine holds are tracked too — each fingerprinted with a DEK-derived keyed MAC, its clock
reset when the fingerprint changes (rotation auto-detected). A 14-day look-ahead applies once a secret is
tracked; set `warn_days = 0` to disable the reminder.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `warn_days` | int | 14 | alert when a tracked secret is due within this many days; **`0` disables** the reminder |
| `check_interval_seconds` | num | 86400 | rescan cadence (default 24h); the per-secret re-alert throttle is `[alerts].realert_seconds` |
| `store_key_last_rotated` | str | — | ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` the store DEK was last rotated; **unset ⇒ the DEK is still tracked live-by-default** off a persisted first-seen stamp (this date is an override) |
| `store_key_max_age_days` | int | 365 | rotate the store DEK within this many days of its effective last-rotated (the operator date if set, else the persisted stamp) |
| `secret_max_age_days` | int | 365 | max age for the **non-DEK** tracked secret classes (connector/AD/SMTP/Vault/OIDC), alerted this many days after their last observed fingerprint change |
| `enforce_grace_days` | int | 30 | under `[security].enforcement=enforce`, a DEK older than `store_key_max_age_days + this` escalates its rotation alert at restart (still an alert, never a refusal) |

```toml
[secret_rotation]
store_key_last_rotated = "2026-01-15"   # when you last ran rotate-key
store_key_max_age_days = 365            # remind me a year later
warn_days = 30                          # start 30 days ahead

# Page when the store DEK is overdue for rotation.
[[alerts.rules]]
event_type = "secret_rotation"
severity = "warning"
transports = ["email"]
```

### `[cluster]` — active-passive HA coordination (Track B)
**Server-DB-backed.** Introduces the multi-node coordination seam — a `nodes` table, a per-node
heartbeat, (Track B Step 4) **leader election**, and (Step 6) **cross-node reference + config-reload
convergence** — *without changing single-node behavior*. It runs as **active-passive** HA: one leader
runs the whole graph, a standby takes over on failure. (The horizontal **active-active** scale-out path
— per-lane ownership running the graph on every node — was **dropped (2026-06-18) and its code removed**;
it is not a planned milestone.) With
`enabled = false` (the default) the engine uses a no-op coordinator and runs **byte-identically** to
before. Enabling it requires a **server-DB** store **and** `[store].pool_size >= 2` — a clustered node
drives concurrent background work (the membership/lease-renewal maintenance loop + the per-stage workers)
against the pool, so a pool of 1 would serialize everything (prefer `>= 3`). A cross-section validator
refuses either violation at config load. Two backends qualify:

- **`postgres`** — the full coordinator: leader election, the row leases, and the leader reclaim sweep,
  run as active-passive HA (the leader runs the graph; a standby takes over on failure).
- **`sqlserver`** — **active-passive too**: the same self-fencing leadership lease (one leader drains
  the graph; a standby takes over on failure). A single active node (the leader) processes at a time, so
  the `reclaim_expired_leases` background sweep below applies on Postgres; on-promotion recovery covers
  both backends.

SQLite remains single-node (cluster coordination is refused on it).

With `[cluster].enabled` on Postgres, **leader election is built** as a **self-fencing lease**
(Workstream A2): exactly one node across the cluster holds the `leader_lease` row and is the
**leader** — it renews the lease every `heartbeat_seconds` (to `DB_now + leader_lease_ttl_seconds`,
on the database's own clock so node clock skew is irrelevant to who may hold it), and a standby
acquires only once that lease has **expired**. A leader that cannot renew within
`leader_fence_timeout_seconds` (which must be `< leader_lease_ttl_seconds`) **self-fences** — it stops
acting as leader *before* the lease can expire and a standby acquire it, so a network-partitioned old
leader never double-processes (the split-brain guard). The leader-only **WRITE singletons**
run on that one node while followers **no-op** them (reactive-by-polling, so failover is automatic on
the next tick):
- **`[retention]` purge/VACUUM/audit** — runs on the leader only.
- **the lease-reclaim sweep** — the leader periodically calls `reclaim_expired_leases` (cadence
  `reclaim_interval_seconds`) to recover **crashed** nodes' in-flight rows (only rows whose lease has
  *expired*, never a live sibling's). In clustered mode the engine therefore **skips** the
  single-node unconditional `reset_stale_inflight` startup recovery, which would steal a live
  sibling's in-flight rows.

**Poll-source intake is leader-gated (Track B Step 4b).** A **poll** source — `file` (a watched
directory), `database` (a polled table), `remote-file` (an SFTP/FTP directory) — reads a **shared
external resource**: if more than one node polled it, the same file/row would be ingested twice. So
only the **leader** polls a poll source. Under active-passive HA the whole graph — **listen** sources
(`mllp`, `tcp`) and all the **staged-queue workers** (router / transform / delivery) alike — runs on the
**leader only**; a standby binds no listeners and runs no workers (so poll-source gating is
belt-and-suspenders, and the queue's `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` + row leases serve intra-node concurrency
and failover recovery rather than concurrent multi-node draining). The brief overlap during a leadership
transition (the old leader's last in-flight poll vs. the new leader's first) is bounded by the same
at-least-once guarantees that cover a crash mid-poll — the file-rename / row-claim atomicity and the
downstream queue's idempotent handoff make a re-read a tolerated duplicate, never data loss. The
worst-case transition window is bounded by the lease timing: a partitioned leader keeps polling until
it self-fences (within `leader_fence_timeout_seconds`), and a standby cannot take over until the lease
expires (`leader_lease_ttl_seconds`) — and `fence < TTL` guarantees the old leader has stopped first.
For a
`database` source the row-claim atomicity is the operator's `poll_statement`/`mark_statement` (claim
with a status flag or `UPDATE ... RETURNING`); the engine owns the atomic rename only for file sources.

If the leader stops cleanly it expires its lease so a follower acquires leadership at once; if it
crashes or is partitioned, the lease ages out and a follower acquires after at most
`leader_lease_ttl_seconds`. **Single-node operation is unchanged** (the no-op coordinator is always
leader, so every poll source always scans, runs the unconditional startup reset, and spawns no leader
sweep).

**Per-lane FIFO survives failover.** Because the graph runs on the **leader only**, per-lane FIFO is
naturally serialized by that single processor — there is no concurrent multi-node draining of a lane to
reorder. Across a failover the order still has to be preserved for a lane whose head was in flight on the
crashed/fenced prior leader: the ordinary FIFO claim (`claim_next_fifo`) reclaims that **stranded head**
— this lane's expired-lease inflight row, back to pending **in the same transaction, before the head
SELECT** — so the recovered head blocks the lane rather than being skipped, and a later row can never
deliver ahead of it (the recovery does not wait on the leader's periodic sweep). This **replaced** the
dropped active-active per-lane lease mechanism (the removed `lane_leases` table / per-lane ownership). The
wall-clock row lease carries the NTP assumption: keep `[store].lease_ttl_seconds` comfortably above clock
skew + the claim cadence. **Single-node is byte-identical** (the no-op coordinator is always leader);
SQLite and SQL Server behave the same single-active-processor way.

**Cross-node convergence is built (Track B Step 6).** Two shared-state concerns now converge across
nodes automatically:
- **Reference sets** — materialize-from-source is **leader-gated** (only the leader re-reads the
  external file/DB source and writes the shared, versioned snapshot), and **every** node then
  **read-throughs** that snapshot into its own in-process read cache via the store's
  `converge_reference_cache` (matching on the per-set version). So the external source is read **once**
  per cluster and no follower is left on a stale cache — replacing the prior "every node re-syncs" model.
  Single-node is byte-identical: the no-op coordinator is always leader (materializes every pass) and
  the convergence call is a no-op on SQLite (the sole writer's cache is always current).
- **Config reload** — an operator `POST /config/reload` on **one** node bumps a single-row
  `cluster_config` **version token**; every **other** node's config-convergence loop observes the higher
  version and reloads **its own** (identically-deployed) config dir to converge. The initiating node
  advances its applied version when it bumps, so it does **not** re-reload (no feedback loop). A
  `dry_run` never bumps; single-node never spawns the loop. This assumes **homogeneous config** across
  nodes (the token coordinates *when* to reload; each node reloads its own dir) — the same assumption as
  the dead-letter-missing-destinations/handlers startup sweeps.

> The coordination seam is **built**: leader election (self-fencing lease), leader-gated singletons +
> poll-source intake, failover-safe per-lane FIFO (the stranded-head reclaim above), cross-node reference
> + config convergence, transform-STATE cross-node read-through (Step 6b), and the read-only `/cluster`

> leader self-fences before its lease expires.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | turn on the coordination seam; requires a server-DB store (`[store].backend` = `postgres` or `sqlserver`) and `[store].pool_size >= 2` |
| `node_id` | str | _unset_ | override the auto id (`host:pid:hex`); pin for a stable identity / tests. Unset → reuses the store's lease owner-id, so node-id == owner-id |
| `heartbeat_seconds` | num | 10 | how often a node refreshes its `last_seen` heartbeat **and** renews its leadership lease (no separate leader-check knob). Must be > 0 |
| `node_timeout_seconds` | num | 30 | a node is considered dead when its `last_seen` is older than this (the `/cluster/nodes` freshness filter). The leadership **lease** — not this timeout — is what transfers leadership. Must be > 0, and must exceed `heartbeat_seconds` |
| `reclaim_interval_seconds` | num | 30 | how often the **leader** runs the lease-reclaim sweep that recovers crashed nodes' in-flight rows (followers no-op). Must be > 0 |
| `leader_lease_ttl_seconds` | num | 30 | the leadership lease TTL (active-passive self-fencing). The leader renews to `DB_now + this`; a standby acquires only once the lease has expired (on the DB clock, so node skew is irrelevant). Must be > 0 |
| `leader_fence_timeout_seconds` | num | 20 | a leader that can't renew within this (its own monotonic clock, no DB I/O) self-fences — the split-brain guard. Must be > 0, `> heartbeat_seconds`, and `< leader_lease_ttl_seconds` |
| `acquire_delay_seconds` | num | 0 | **leader-preference handicap** (ADR 0096, per-node). Seconds this node waits PAST the lease-expiry time before it may take over an **expired** lease, so a preferred (`0`) node wins the routine take-over race. NEVER delays a renewal by the current leader, and only ever makes a node claim later — so it can't open a two-leader window. Governs take-over of an expired lease only (the first election on an empty table is a plain race). Must be `>= 0`. Surfaced per-node in `/cluster/nodes` |
| `promotable` | bool | true | **non-promotable standby** flag (ADR 0096, per-node). `false` = this node may never become leader (never inserts/takes-over/renews the lease); a node that somehow already leads steps down cleanly. Use for a warm, passive DR engine. **At least one promotable node must exist** or no node ever acquires the lease. `[dr].activate` cannot be combined with `[cluster].enabled` (a warm DR node is a non-promotable member, not a `[dr]` box). Surfaced per-node in `/cluster/nodes` |

### `[backup]` — scheduled DR backup / restore-verify
Engine-managed **scheduled + on-demand DR backup** of the config bundle and the SQLite store, written as
one AES-256-GCM `.mfbak` archive to a local/UNC destination (#60,
[ADR 0049](adr/0049-turnkey-dr-backup-restore-verify.md)). **Opt-in:** `enabled = false` (the default) is a
complete no-op. When enabled, the leader-gated `BackupRunner`
([pipeline/dr_backup.py](../messagefoundry/pipeline/dr_backup.py)) takes a **consistent SQLite snapshot**
(read-only against the live store — it never claims or mutates a staged-queue row), bundles the loaded
`--config` dir, encrypts under the existing store DEK (ADR 0019 KeyProvider), applies keep-N retention, runs
a lightweight restore-verify, and records one PHI-free `dr_backup` audit row. **No cloud target** — local /
UNC only, so it adds no egress. On a **server-DB** store (Postgres/SQL Server) the *database* backup is
DBA-delegated (#52): config-only, or skipped, per `config_only_on_server_db`.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | opt-in master switch; a deployment with no `[backup]` is unaffected |
| `destination` | path | `""` | local or UNC destination dir (e.g. `D:/mefor-backups`). **Required (non-empty) when enabled.** A cloud URL (`s3://`, `https://`, …) is **rejected** — there is no cloud target |
| `schedule_at` | str | `"02:00"` | daily local `"HH:MM"` the scheduled backup runs at (the same clock grammar as `[retention].vacuum_at`). `""` = **on-demand only** (the `messagefoundry backup` CLI), no scheduled pass |
| `retention_keep` | int | `7` | keep-N: after a successful, **verified** new archive, prune the oldest archives beyond the newest N at the destination. `0` = keep all. A verify-**failed** archive is never counted as a good backup when pruning, so a failing run can't evict the last good one |
| `snapshot_method` | str | `vacuum_into` | `vacuum_into` (default; takes a writer lock, sized for the off-peak schedule) or `online_backup` (low-contention, page-batched) |
| `include_config` | bool | `true` | bundle the loaded `--config` dir into the archive, so the cold seed is self-sufficient (store **plus** the config that interprets it) without assuming the DR box can reach the org's git repo |
| `verify_after_backup` | bool | `true` | run the lightweight restore-verify after every backup (open + `integrity_check` + row-count). On by default — a backup nobody has opened is a backup that silently doesn't restore |
| `full_restore_verify` | bool | `false` | the heavier verify: restore the snapshot to a throwaway temp DB and open it through the real `open_store` path. On-demand / opt-in extra, deliberately **not** the per-backup default |
| `config_only_on_server_db` | bool | `true` | on a Postgres/SQL Server store the DB backup is DBA-delegated (#52), so back up the **config bundle only**. `false` = skip the backup entirely on a server-DB store (not even a config-only archive) |
| `allow_unencrypted` | bool | `false` | audited escape permitting a **cleartext** archive on a **no-key synthetic** instance (the parallel of `[security].allow_unencrypted_phi`). A **PHI** instance with no key still **refuses** to write an unencrypted archive regardless of this flag |

### `[dr]` — third-tier disaster-recovery standby
A **right-sized DR box** that activates only when the whole HA pair / site is gone and then runs **only the
high-priority feeds** in a deliberately degraded mode — the inverse of the dropped active-active scale-out
(it runs *less*, not more) (#61, [ADR 0048](adr/0048-third-tier-disaster-recovery-standby.md)). **Opt-in:**
`enabled = false` (the default) is a complete no-op. On activation the engine cold-seeds the store from a
`[backup]` `.mfbak` archive (fail-closed if the KeyProvider/DEK is unreachable at the DR site), starts only
the connections whose resolved priority tier is at or above `priority_threshold` (the rest report
`status: "filtered"`), and is fenced by **acquire-VIP-or-abort**. **Activation is manual** — `POST
/dr/activate`, gated by the `dr:operate` permission; no health probe ever activates it. `enabled`/`activate`
are read at engine start. `[dr].activate` **cannot be combined with `[cluster].enabled`** (refused at load):
a warm DR-site engine is a non-promotable cluster member, not a lease-contending DR box.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | is this deployment a DR standby box at all? `false` = the normal run-profile (every connection starts, subject only to ADR 0031), byte-unchanged |
| `activate` | bool | `false` | should this box come up **under the DR run-profile** on this boot — the startup activation latch, distinct from the runtime `POST /dr/activate` endpoint. Enabled but `activate = false` is *provisioned-but-passive*: it binds no priority feeds until an operator activates it. A no-op unless `enabled` |
| `activation_mode` | enum | `manual` | `manual` is the **only built mode** — the DR box promotes solely on the explicit, RBAC-gated operator action. `auto` (the box detects HA-pair loss and self-promotes) is named so a forward-looking config is explicit, but config load **rejects** it with a "not yet supported" error — never a silent no-op |
| `priority_threshold` | enum | `critical` | start **only** connections whose resolved priority rank is at or above this tier (`[delivery].priority` + a per-connection `priority=`). `critical` (owner-locked default) starts only the critical feeds; `normal` would also start normal-tier ones. A below-threshold connection reports `status: "filtered"` — distinct from ADR 0031's `"failed"`. An unknown value fails config load |
| `takeover_hook` | str | `""` | **optional** operator command run before binding the priority listeners: exit 0 = "VIP acquired", any non-zero or timeout = "not acquired" and **activation aborts**. For an ADR 0047 load-balancer topology the passive LB is the fence and this is belt-and-braces only. `""` = no hook; a whitespace-only value is rejected at load (it would run an empty shell and "succeed") |
| `release_hook` | str | `""` | the symmetric command run on `POST /dr/release` to hand the VIP back to the recovered primary. `""` = no hook; whitespace-only rejected at load |
| `takeover_timeout_seconds` | float (>0) | `30.0` | bound on the takeover/release hook **and** on the KeyProvider-reachability check at the DR site: a hook or key probe that doesn't succeed within this **aborts activation closed** — no hang, no silent retry-forever |
| `seed_archive` | path | `""` | the `.mfbak` archive to cold-seed the DR store from on activation. `""` = the operator supplies the archive path in the `POST /dr/activate` request body instead (the runbook path). A cloud URL is rejected — local/UNC only, like the backup destination |
| `restore_token` | path | `""` | **opt-in server-DB DR restore token** (BACKLOG #223, [ADR 0102](adr/0102-server-db-dr-restore-vintage-completeness-attestation-residual.md)). A local/UNC path to a small JSON token the DBA places on the DR box recording the **expected** source-backup anchor of a native (Postgres/SQL Server) restore. When set, the server-DB seed gate cross-checks it against the restored database's own latest successful `dr_backup` archive — a **vintage floor** a bare boolean attestation cannot give: a stale or wrong native restore's latest anchor differs, so activation **refuses closed**. `""` (default) = off (the gate is byte-unchanged; SQLite is a no-op). A cloud URL is rejected |

### `[approvals]`
Optional **dual-control (maker-checker)** approval for high-value actions (ASVS 2.3.5) — see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). **Off by default**; turning it on holds the listed operations for a
*distinct* second approver holding `approvals:approve`, with the requester unable to approve their own.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | turn on dual-control; off = every action executes inline as before |
| `operations` | list[str] | `["connection_purge", "dead_letter_replay"]` | which operations require approval; each must be a known op key (a typo is refused at startup) |
| `expiry_hours` | num | 72 | a pending request can no longer be approved after this many hours (`0` = never expires) |

### `[integrity]`
Startup **self-attestation of the installed engine wheel** ([ADR 0041](adr/0041-load-path-attestation-and-change-attribution.md)
D3) — a runtime in-place-tamper tripwire (`messagefoundry/integrity.py`). At startup (and on demand) the
engine hashes every **loaded** first-party `messagefoundry` module file against the installed wheel's
`*.dist-info/RECORD` baseline; on **drift** (a loaded module no longer matching its RECORD hash) it records
a hash-chained `startup_integrity` audit row and fires the `AlertSink`. It complements ADR 0036 (which guards
the *config dir*) by covering the installed *site-packages* an admin with venv-write + restart rights could
edit in place. Both keys default **safe**: attestation is on but **alert-only** (it never blocks startup), and
an **editable** install (`pip install -e .` — no RECORD baseline) is a **no-op**, so dev is never bricked.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | run startup attestation at all. On by default (alert-only is harmless); a **no-op** off an editable install. Set `false` only to suppress the check entirely (e.g. an unusual packaging where RECORD is known-stale) — you then lose the in-place-tamper tripwire. |
| `fail_closed_on_drift` | bool | `false` | when `true`, drift makes `serve` **refuse to start** (after recording the audit row + alerting). Default `false` = **alert-only**: a legitimate reviewed in-place security hotfix (the documented vendored-parser patch contingency) would itself trip a RECORD mismatch, so fail-closed-by-default would brick a legitimate patch. Opt in for hard enforcement on a locked-down instance. |
| `audit_verify_on_start` | bool | `false` | when `true`, the engine **re-walks the tamper-evident `audit_log` hash chain once at startup** (#190). **Alert-only by construction:** a broken chain logs a WARNING and fires the `AlertSink` but **never** crashes startup — a refuse-to-start on a tripped tamper alarm would be a self-inflicted DoS. Default `false` (opt in): on a very large `audit_log` the full re-walk adds startup latency, so it is not on by default. |

### `[engine]`
**Not implemented.** There is **no `EngineSettings` model**, so an `[engine]` block in
`messagefoundry.toml` is parsed and **silently dropped** (`ServiceSettings` is `extra="ignore"`). The rows
below are the shape a future section would take, not knobs that do anything today. In particular
`data_dir` does **not** anchor relative paths — reach for `[environments].base_dir` /
`serve --project-root` for `env()` value files, and `--db` / `[store].path` for the store, instead.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shutdown_timeout_seconds` | int | — | **accepted-but-ignored** (proposed): graceful stop. The ASGI lifespan's `engine.stop()` is not bounded by a setting today |
| `data_dir` | str | — | **accepted-but-ignored** (proposed): base for relative paths. Setting it anchors nothing |

### `[service]` (NSSM / Windows)
The NSSM **install** knobs — auto-restart, stdout/stderr log paths — live in `scripts/service/`. The
section here is the engine's **read-only** report of its own Windows-service run state to the console
(L6a, [ADR 0065](adr/0065-web-ops-dashboard.md)): an unprivileged `sc query <service_name>` off the event
loop, surfaced at `GET /service/status` and gated by `monitoring:read`. There is deliberately **no
control** here — no start/stop/restart, the engine can't restart its own host over the API. Off by
default, and **file-only** (`[service]` has no `MEFOR_*` env layer).

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `report_status` | bool | `false` | report the run state; off = no `sc query` ever runs and the route answers `state = "disabled"` |
| `service_name` | str | `""` | the Windows service to query. Letters, digits, space, `.`, `_`, `-` only (anything else is refused at load); empty = disabled |

### `[security]`
The **canonical, plain-language home for the high-value security posture switches**
([ADR 0118](adr/0118-secure-by-default-security-configuration-section.md)). Each switch **defaults to the
secure position**; loosening one is deliberate and **warned at `serve`** (see
[SECURITY-LOOSENING.md](SECURITY-LOOSENING.md) for what each opt-out gives up + its ASVS/NIST/HIPAA
mapping). This section **replaces** the scattered legacy keys — setting a moved key in its old section
(`[api].host`, `[api].serve_ui`, `[api].public_origin`, `[auth].enabled`, `[auth].require_mfa`,
`[auth].session_idle_timeout_minutes`, `[auth].session_absolute_hours`, `[store].allow_unencrypted_phi`,
`[egress].deny_by_default`, `[retention].messages_days`, `[retention].allow_unbounded_phi`,
`[diagnostics].audit_all_authz`, `[ai].data_class`, `[ai].production`) is **rejected at load** with a
pointer to its `[security]` replacement. Low-level *plumbing* (TLS cert paths, `[egress].allowed_*`
contents, `[retention].dead_letter_days`, DB identity, password policy, rate limits, AD/LDAP) stays in its
functional section.

Under the hood the loader **desugars** `[security]` into those internal fields, so every serve gate + the
`checks.py` commit/CI mirror keep enforcing exactly as before — **no shipped refusal is loosened**
(the *No-loosen rule*, [ADR 0092](adr/0092-posture-keyed-transport-hop-refusal-refuse-the-insecure-phi-hop.md) §5),
and a PHI weakening under **strict enforcement** (`enforcement = enforce`, the default) still fails closed
regardless of any value here — byte-identical to the former production-PHI refusal
([ADR 0148](adr/0148-phi-default-posture-and-an-explicit-security-enforcement-level.md)).

| key | type | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `local_access_only` | bool | `true` | reachable only from this machine (loopback bind) |
| `listen_address` | str | `"127.0.0.1"` | bind address — used only when `local_access_only = false` |
| `require_encryption_for_remote` | bool | `true` | any off-machine access must be over TLS (config-file twin of `--allow-insecure-bind`; can't relax production-PHI) |
| `serve_web_console` | bool | `true` | mount the browser ops console at `/ui` — **on by default** ([ADR 0143](adr/0143-web-console-on-by-default-disableable-with-loopback-secure-context-browser-hardening.md)); set `false` to shrink to a JSON-only surface. Default-on applies to **local loopback** binds; on an exposed instance a default-on console auto-degrades to JSON-only unless explicitly enabled with TLS + `web_console_public_address` |
| `web_console_public_address` | str | `""` | external origin when the console is exposed off-box (CSRF/CSWSH + WebAuthn RP-id) |
| `allowed_client_networks` | list[str] | `[]` | **`[BUILT]` ([ADR 0151](adr/0151-operator-surface-source-network-allow-list-security-allowed-client-networks.md)):** source-address allow-list for the **operator API + web console**. **Empty (the default) = no restriction.** Non-empty = a request whose client address is outside every listed network is refused **403 in middleware, before routing and before sign-in** (also covers `/ui`, `/ui/static`, `/ws/stats`). Entries are CIDR networks or bare hosts (`"10.20.0.0/16"`, `"2001:db8::/48"`, `"10.20.4.7"` → `/32`), IPv4 + IPv6 mixed; malformed entries are **refused at load** and valid ones are stored normalized (`10.1.2.3/24` → `10.1.2.0/24`). **Loopback is always allowed**, with no knob (the tray `/health` poll, an on-box browser, `messagefoundry check` and a container HEALTHCHECK cannot be allow-listed). **Operator surface only** — the ingest listeners keep their own per-connection `[inbound].source_ip_allowlist`. **It matches the address uvicorn reports, so it is INERT behind an UNDECLARED proxy / NAT / a bridged container** — declare the proxy in `[api].trusted_proxies` or this does nothing; `curl /health` and read `observed_client` to check. Setting it **tightens `[api].trusted_proxies` to single hosts** (a broad range would let every host inside it forge its own source address). Startup-only: a lockout costs a service restart. Defence-in-depth **behind** the host firewall, not the primary network control — read OFF-LOOPBACK-DEPLOYMENT.md first. Env: `MEFOR_SECURITY_ALLOWED_CLIENT_NETWORKS` (**comma**-separated). |
| `encrypt_stored_data` | bool | `true` | PHI encrypted at rest (key from the environment) |
| `allow_unencrypted_phi` | bool | `false` | audited escape: start a PHI instance with **no** key |
| `allow_unencrypted_phi_under_strict_enforcement` | bool | `false` | the **second acknowledgment** required to start a PHI instance keyless under strict enforcement ([ADR 0140](adr/0140-two-acknowledged-production-phi-no-loosen-carve-outs-single-factor-admin-at-exposure-keyless-phi-in-production.md)). Under `enforcement = enforce`, `allow_unencrypted_phi = true` on its own is **not** enough — `serve` still refuses to start (exit 2) unless this is also set, so the highest-risk posture (real PHI + strict enforcement) is never one flag away from plaintext at rest. Under `enforcement = warn` the single `allow_unencrypted_phi` flag still governs. With both set the instance starts with PHI bodies, summary/metadata and the error columns **unencrypted at rest**, and the startup AUDIT line names **both** flags. A **loosening** — `security_loosenings()` reports it, so it is never silent |
| `allow_single_factor_admin_when_exposed` | bool | `false` | permit **single-factor admin on an exposed PHI instance** (ADR 0140). With `require_sign_in` on, `require_mfa` explicitly off, and the operator surface exposed (a non-loopback bind, or the console reached through a declared TLS-terminating proxy), a PHI instance under `enforcement = enforce` **refuses to start** (exit 2) — the Administrator role would authenticate with a single factor over the network. Setting this permits that start; it is recorded in a WARNING-level AUDIT line and the ordinary exposure warning still prints. A **loosening** — `security_loosenings()` reports it. Prefer `require_mfa = true`: it gates only **local** Administrator accounts (directory MFA is delegated), so it is safe to leave on even on an AD-only deployment |
| `memory_encryption_operator_declared` | bool | `false` | **`[BUILT]` ([ADR 0152](adr/0152-in-use-data-protection-for-phi-platform-memory-encryption-attestation-asvs-11-7-1.md) rung 2, ASVS 11.7.1):** the operator's **declaration** that this host provides hardware memory encryption (AMD SEV-SNP / Intel TDX), so PHI is protected in RAM **while it is being processed**. The engine cannot verify it — a local CPU flag is emitted by the OS whose integrity the requirement protects against — so this records **who took responsibility**, the same discipline as `MEFOR_TLS_REVOCATION_ATTESTED`. It is deliberately **not** called "attested": in confidential computing that word means a CPU-signed quote verified against the silicon vendor's root PKI (ADR 0152 rung 3, **not built**). An **exposed** PHI instance without it **warns and starts** — on every environment, at both `enforcement` settings; it refuses only if `require_memory_encryption_declaration` is also set. A **positive platform read-out does not substitute for it** (a read-out must never relax a control). **Loopback and synthetic instances are byte-identical** (never consulted). If the platform read-out positively contradicts this, the contradiction is **warned at start and reported** as `memory_encryption_readout_contradicts_declaration` on `GET /security/posture` — but **never refused** (the read-out is a self-report, not evidence, and has known false negatives: driver not loaded, container without the device node mapped, Azure CVM paravisor). **Setting this does not make the instance ASVS 11.7.1-compliant** — see the read-out note below the table. Env: `MEFOR_SECURITY_MEMORY_ENCRYPTION_OPERATOR_DECLARED` |
| `require_memory_encryption_declaration` | bool | `false` | **`[BUILT]` (ADR 0152 rung 2):** turn the row-12 warning above into a **refusal** — an **exposed** PHI instance with no `memory_encryption_operator_declared` then **refuses to start** under `enforcement=enforce` (and still warns under `warn`). **Opt-in by design, and the default is load-bearing:** the property is a **host** property that no operator can satisfy on Windows (the read-out is always `null` there), and "exposed" includes the recommended loopback-behind-proxy topology, so a refusal by default would stop working dev/staging/prod deployments from booting on upgrade over something they cannot change. Same scoping rule as `[security].allowed_client_networks`' companion refusal (ADR 0151): a new refusal fires only on a new opt-in. Set it in an estate that has standardized on confidential-computing hosts and wants a missing declaration to be fatal. Env: `MEFOR_SECURITY_REQUIRE_MEMORY_ENCRYPTION_DECLARATION` |
| `require_sign_in` | bool | `true` | authenticate every request |
| `require_mfa` | bool | `true` | second factor (native TOTP or a WebAuthn passkey), enforced as an **access gate** since ASVS 6.3.3 — an MFA-pending session is refused on *every* authorized route with `403` + `X-MFA-Required: 1`, and a browser session is confined to `/ui/mfa`. |
| `require_mfa_scope` | `"administrators"` \| `"every_local_account"` | `"every_local_account"` | **Which local accounts must ENROL a factor** when `require_mfa` is on (ASVS 6.3.3). An account that has already enrolled one must always satisfy it, under either value — this dial only decides who is required to enrol in the first place. `administrators` restores the pre-6.3.3 posture and is reported as a **loosening** on `GET /security/posture` (advisory, not a refusal: refusing to boot on it would break every existing deployment on upgrade). Directory (AD/Kerberos) identities are out of scope under either value — their MFA is delegated to the directory. **Operator note:** under the default a non-interactive **local bearer-token service account** becomes MFA-pending and cannot enrol unattended — move it to mTLS (`require_service_cert`, exempt by design) or to AD, or set this to `administrators`.

| `handles_real_patient_data` | bool | *derived* | the master data-class lever (was `[ai].data_class = "phi"`). Unset ⇒ derived from the environment name — **all three built-in names (`dev`/`staging`/`prod`) now derive PHI** ([ADR 0148](adr/0148-phi-default-posture-and-an-explicit-security-enforcement-level.md) GIVEN 1, so the default/CI path exercises the encryption/egress/retention controls rather than first meeting them in production); a genuinely-synthetic dev/CI box must set `false` **explicitly** (a loud, audited opt-out), and a custom-named env must declare it |
| `enforcement` | `enforce` \| `warn` | `enforce` | the serve-gate **refuse/warn dial** + the [ADR 0092](adr/0092-posture-keyed-transport-hop-refusal-refuse-the-insecure-phi-hop.md) escape-clamp key ([ADR 0148](adr/0148-phi-default-posture-and-an-explicit-security-enforcement-level.md) GIVEN 2). `enforce` (default) **refuses** every PHI serve-gate violation and shuts every blunt escape-clamp — byte-identical to the former production-tier behaviour; `warn` logs + audits + continues and honours the escapes (a loud, audited loosening, named by `security_loosenings()`). **Decoupled from `production_instance`** (env `MEFOR_SECURITY_ENFORCEMENT`) |
| `production_instance` | bool | *derived* | production-tier posture (was `[ai].production`). Derived from the environment name when unset (`prod` → yes; `dev`/`staging` → no). **Informational since [ADR 0148](adr/0148-phi-default-posture-and-an-explicit-security-enforcement-level.md)** — drives the AI data-scope ceiling, the DEBUG-log refusal, and reporting, **not** the serve-gate refuse/warn dial (that is `enforcement`) |

**Editing is IDE-only**: the VS Code extension's *Edit Security Settings* command (which shells
`messagefoundry security show|set`) is the sole authoring surface. The **web console is read-only** — the
effective posture, active loosenings, and the synthetic-relaxation notice are surfaced at
`GET /security/posture` (authenticated, `monitoring:read`). Authentication & RBAC *plumbing* remains in
**`[auth]`** (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)); the at-rest-encryption *key* is a secret supplied via
`MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `[store].encryption_key_file` ([PHI.md](PHI.md#3-encryption-at-rest)).

The section is read at engine **startup**, so an edited switch takes effect on the next engine restart
(`POST /config/reload` re-runs the `--config` graph, not `[security]`).

### The memory-encryption read-out is *not* a compliance claim

`GET /security/posture` also carries a **report-only** platform read-out beside the FIPS attestation
([ADR 0152](adr/0152-in-use-data-protection-for-phi-platform-memory-encryption-attestation-asvs-11-7-1.md)
rung 1): `memory_encryption_self_reported_capability`, `memory_encryption_self_reported_active`,
`memory_encryption_self_reported_mechanism` and `memory_encryption_readout_source`. On Linux these come
from `/proc/cpuinfo` flags (**capability** — "this silicon *can*") and guest device-node presence
`/dev/sev-guest` / `/dev/tdx_guest` (**activation** — "this guest *is*"), which are deliberately reported
as **separate fields** and never derived from one another. On **Windows every field is `null`**
(undeterminable): the in-guest attestation path is an ADR 0152 spike that has not landed, and guessing
would be worse than saying so.

**No value of any of these fields satisfies ASVS 11.7.1**, and none may be cited as though it did.
They are values the **host OS emits about itself**, and 11.7.1 exists precisely because that host may be
the adversary — a compromised kernel or hypervisor forges every one of them. Only a **CPU-signed
attestation report verified against the silicon vendor's root PKI** would be evidence; that is ADR 0152
rung 3 and is **not built**. Treat the read-out as configuration confirmation, never as proof.

**The response says so itself.** Every posture body carries `memory_encryption_note` — the same sentence
the startup warning prints — so the disclaimer travels with any copy of the artifact rather than living
only here. Two more fields are deliberately shaped so they cannot be quoted as compliance:
`memory_encryption_operator_declared` (named for what it is: an operator's word, not an attestation) and
`memory_encryption_readout_contradicts_declaration`, which is **tri-state**. `null` on that field means
*nothing was measured that could contradict anything* — the answer on Windows, on an AMD SME / Intel TME
host (memory-controller-wide encryption, which has no guest interface to find), in a container without
the device node mapped, and whenever nobody declared anything. A `false` means the read-out **agrees**,
and it is never emitted by vacuity.

**The property itself is a host requirement, not a switch.**
`memory_encryption_operator_declared = true` records a claim; it does not create memory encryption. An
ASVS **Level 3** PHI deployment must actually run the engine as a **confidential guest** on an AMD
SEV-SNP or Intel TDX host —
[SYSTEM-REQUIREMENTS.md](SYSTEM-REQUIREMENTS.md#hardware-memory-encryption--required-for-an-asvs-level-3-phi-deployment)
states the requirement and the (verified) availability picture, which today is **not reachable for a
Windows guest on on-premises Hyper-V or ESXi**. On a host that does not provide the property, the honest
configuration is **not** to set this: leave it unset, keep the startup warning, and disclose 11.7.1 as
**Partial**. Reaching for `[security].enforcement = warn` is the wrong lever — that is the global
refuse/warn dial and downgrades every other posture refusal at the same time; nothing about this control
requires it, because it never refuses unless you opt in via `require_memory_encryption_declaration`. The
step-by-step is in OFF-LOOPBACK-DEPLOYMENT.md
§ *In-use data protection*.

## Example

```toml
# messagefoundry.toml
[store]
backend = "sqlserver"
server = "sql01.hospital.local"
database = "MessageFoundry"
auth = "sql"
username = "mefor_service"
encrypt = true

[security]
local_access_only = true                # loopback bind (ADR 0118; the bind host lives here, not [api])
delete_message_bodies_after_days = 30   # the PHI-body window (ADR 0118; NOT [retention].messages_days)

[api]
port = 8765

[logging]
level = "info"
format = "json"                       # structured stdout (one JSON object per line)
# Setting forward_host turns forwarding ON by default (ADR 0080); forward_enabled = false opts out.
forward_host = "siem.hospital.local"  # ship a copy off-box to a syslog/SIEM collector
forward_port = 6514                   # RFC 5425 syslog-over-TLS default
forward_protocol = "tls"              # udp (default) | tcp | tls (native RFC 5425, no agent)
forward_tls_ca_file = "C:/mefor/siem-ca.pem"   # required for tls unless forward_tls_verify = false
# Opt-in startup clock-sync gate (ASVS 16.2.2) — warns on skew; add fail-closed to refuse start:
# require_time_sync = true
# ntp_peer = "ntp.hospital.local"

[retention]
# The inbound-body window is [security].delete_message_bodies_after_days above — setting
# messages_days here is REJECTED at load (ADR 0118). Only the plumbing keys stay in this section:
dead_letter_days = 90   # null dead-letter bodies after 90 days
vacuum_at = "03:30"     # daily off-peak VACUUM to reclaim space (SQLite only)
```
```bash
# secret via env (never in the file)
set MEFOR_STORE_PASSWORD=...
```

## Build order (incremental)

1. ✅ **Done** — `ServiceSettings` model + loader (file + env + CLI precedence); `[api]`/`[logging]`
   and `[store] backend=sqlite|path|synchronous` wired into `serve` (`--service-config` + the
   `--db`/`--host`/`--port`/`--log-level` overrides).
2. ✅ **Done** — `[delivery]` defaults feed the default `RetryPolicy` (`DeliverySettings.retry_policy()`),
   alongside the ordering / internal-error / buildup-stall-saturation / priority defaults an outbound
   inherits when it declares none.
3. ✅ **Done** — `[store]` server-DB keys landed with the SQL Server **and** Postgres backends (both
   consume `server`/`database`/`username`/`pool_size`/`command_timeout`/`ssl_root_cert`); they are
   **implemented**, not accepted-but-ignored.
4. ✅ **Done** — `[retention]` purge/maintenance job (body-null + WAL/VACUUM, audited; `audit_days`
   reserved). `[logging]` structured-JSON `format` + off-box `forward_*` syslog shipping land
   (sec-offbox-log); PHI redaction is an always-on handler filter (no structlog).

## Open decisions (to confirm)

- ✅ **Decided and built** — **TOML file + env + CLI** as above, chosen for consistency with
  `pyproject.toml` and ops-friendliness; secrets via env.
- ✅ **Settled — the IDE authors, the web console reads.** Settings are **edited from the VS Code
  extension** (its *Edit Security Settings* command shells `messagefoundry security show|set`, which owns
  the TOML write) or by hand in `messagefoundry.toml`; there is **no settings-write API**. The web console
  is **read-only** on posture — `GET /security/posture` (authenticated, `monitoring:read`) surfaces the
  effective switches and active loosenings. This is the reverse of the split originally sketched here.
- Whether per-connection overrides (e.g. a connection's own retry) stay in code (today) or also move
  into settings. Recommendation: **keep per-connection logic in code**, service settings are defaults.
