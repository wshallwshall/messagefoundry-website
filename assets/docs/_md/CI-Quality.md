# Code Quality & Anti-Slop Standards — Executive Summary

**Is this code good, or is it slop? · MEFOR verdict: A− · July 14, 2026**

How to judge whether code — human- or AI-authored — is actually good, using signals the evidence supports.

| At a glance |  |
|----|----|
| **MEFOR verdict** | **A− / low slop-risk** — all 11 signals Built |
| **Core thesis** | No single number certifies quality — judge enforced structure and verified behavior |
| **Hard rule** | Never gate on coverage %, LOC, complexity, or SonarQube counts alone — all weak or gameable |
| **Proven value** | Caught private security docs shipping in the public PyPI package (fixed, verified at v0.3.0) |
| **Evidence base** | Peer-reviewed and adversarially verified — 20 claims confirmed, 5 popular claims refuted |

### AI slop is real — and measurable

- AI-assisted developers wrote *less* secure code while *more* confident it was secure (Stanford).
- ~14% of distinct Python modules in real ChatGPT output didn't exist ("slopsquatting").
- 2024: copied lines exceeded refactored lines for the first time in industry telemetry.

Each failure mode maps to a specific machine-enforced control — not a vibe check.

### What actually predicts quality

Machine-enforced structure (layer boundaries, strict typing), tests whose assertions are validated by mutation testing, and dependency + published-artifact integrity. The popular scoreboards — coverage %, complexity scores, SonarQube severities — correlate weakly, sometimes *invertedly*, with real defects.

### The MEFOR result

All 11 signals Built and running in CI: enforced boundaries, strict typing, 8,200+ behavior-verifying tests, locked dependencies, 11 security scanners. The one durable gap ever found — the PyPI leak — was caught by this rubric and closed.

# The 11 Signals at a Glance

Simplified from the full rubric (§4) and MEFOR scorecard (Appendix A), which follow. A codebase is judged by the **composite** — never by any single row.

**Tier 1 — durable, high-signal controls (these carry the verdict)**

| \# | Signal | What it asks | MEFOR |
|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | Architecture boundaries | Are module/layer rules machine-checked in CI, not just documented? | ✅ Strong |
| 2 | Strict typing | Full strict type-checking, no blanket suppressions? | ✅ Strong |
| 3 | Tests verify behavior | Do tests assert real values and failure paths — not mock choreography? | ✅ Strong |
| 4 | Dependency integrity | Is every dependency verified to exist and hash-locked? | ✅ Strong |
| 5 | Security scanning + threat model | Blocking scanners plus a written threat model and review? | ✅ Strong |
| 6 | Published-artifact integrity | Do released packages ship *only* intended content? | ✅ Built — caught and fixed a real leak |

**Tier 2 — measurement layer (guidance and triage — never a gate on its own)**

| \# | Signal | What it asks | MEFOR |
|----|----|----|----|
| 7 | Mutation testing | Do the tests actually catch injected bugs? | ✅ Built (advisory) |
| 8 | Coverage visibility | Is coverage reported on changed lines, as guidance? | ✅ Built (advisory) |
| 9 | Duplication / reuse | Is new copy-paste flagged for review? | ✅ Built (advisory) |
| 10 | Lint breadth | Is a broad static-analysis ruleset enforced? | ✅ Built — enforced in the required CI leg |
| 11 | Complexity triage | Are the genuinely large units surfaced for review? | ✅ Built (advisory) |

> **The anti-metric rule:** none of the Tier 2 numbers may ever be *the* quality gate. They surface problems for a human to judge; the Tier 1 structure carries the verdict.

The full standard follows: the evidence review, the AI failure-mode map, the complete rubric, gate placement, the MEFOR scorecard, and the cited methodology.

# Code Quality & Anti-Slop Standards — Evidence-Based Rubric for Judging Code (Human- or AI-Authored)

*A companion standard to [Secure Development Standards](Secure_Development_Standards.md) (SDS) and [Secure AI-Assisted Development Standards](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md) (the AI-build companion). The SDS says **what a secure build must satisfy**; the AI-build companion says **how to build it with an AI assistant** (process, tiers, provenance). This document is the third leg: **how to judge whether the resulting code is actually good — not "AI slop" — using signals the evidence supports, not scoreboards it refutes.** It governs the **outcome**, where the SDS governs the process and the AI companion governs the tooling.*

> **Scope boundary — read this first.** This is a **code-quality measurement rubric**, not a security standard (that is the SDS) and not the AI-build process standard (that is the [Secure AI-Assisted Development Standards](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md)). Where a signal here is *already owned* by a companion — dependency-existence verification, human review, SAST — this doc **points to it and does not restate it.** Its own additions are the *quality-measurement* gates neither companion carries: test-signal proof (mutation), duplication/reuse detection, coverage *visibility*, complexity *triage*, lint breadth, and **published-artifact / supply-chain-*out* integrity** (signal 6).

Evidence base is **peer-reviewed metric-validity studies + DORA 2024 + GitClear + the METR RCT + Stanford CCS'23**, each carried with its honesty caveat (§7). **Confers no certification.** |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Executive summary

**The core thesis, and it is counterintuitive:** *there is no single number that certifies code quality, and every metric people reach for first is a weak or gameable predictor.* Peer-reviewed evidence shows line-coverage %, raw cyclomatic complexity, SonarSource "Cognitive Complexity", and SonarQube issue severities all correlate **weakly — sometimes invertedly** — with real defects and change-proneness (§2). What survives is **structure and behavior, verified by enforced controls**: ISO/IEC 25010 maintainability (low coupling / information hiding), strict typing, tests whose *assertions* are validated (mutation testing as *guidance*, not a gate), dependency integrity, and static analysis in the loop.

**"AI slop" is real but specific.** The evidence names measurable failure modes — a controlled Stanford study found AI-assisted developers wrote *less* secure code yet were *more* confident it was secure; GitClear telemetry shows 2024 was the first year copy/pasted lines exceeded refactored ("moved") lines (the signature of *copy-instead-of-abstract*); ~14.4% of *distinct* Python modules in real ChatGPT output were hallucinated (slopsquatting); DORA 2024 associated AI adoption with a delivery-**stability** drop. The answer to each is a **specific control**, not a vibe (§3).

**This document is a measurement rubric, not another process gate.** It gives (1) the signals that genuinely separate good code from slop, with the honest note that **no validated single-metric cutoff exists** — thresholds are set empirically per project; (2) an anti-metric list of what **not** to gate on; and (3) a scored MEFOR scorecard (Appendix A). **MEFOR's verdict: strong exactly where the evidence says it counts (machine-enforced structure, strict typing, behavior-verifying tests, dependency integrity, security scanning), and — as of this cycle — the *measurement* layer has closed too: mutation, coverage visibility, clone detection, complexity triage, and the broadened lint ruleset all ship as CI gates (#1028/#1040/#1047), so every one of the 11 signals is now Built. The one *durable*-control gap this cycle surfaced — a private-doc leak in the published PyPI sdist — was caught via signal 6 and fixed (#1020), verified clean at v0.3.0.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Purpose, scope, and the lens

This rubric answers one question: **"Is this code good, or is it slop?"** — for code that may be human- or AI-authored, in a repository built largely with an AI assistant across many parallel sessions.

It serves three audiences: **maintainers** (a standing scorecard to re-run each release), **adopters and auditors** (evidence the code is judged against the evidence, not a badge), and **future projects** (their own Appendix).

**The lens — structure over scoreboards.** The evidence is unambiguous that *single-number gates fail*. Therefore this rubric is **composite and structural**: it weights machine-enforced architectural boundaries and validated test signal far above any coverage or complexity number, and it explicitly **forbids** certifying quality on a single metric (§4). This is the quality-measurement analogue of the SDS's "deterministic checks, never ask the model to be secure" principle — *measure structure and behavior, never trust a scoreboard.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. The evidence — validated vs. gameable (read before setting any gate)

Peer-reviewed, [adversarially-verified](#b.2-how-the-matrix-was-derived) findings on what actually predicts quality (full citations → [Appendix B.4](#b.4-references)):

| Popular metric | Verdict | Evidence |
|----|----|----|
| **Cyclomatic complexity** (raw) | **Weak predictor; largely a proxy for LOC.** Use as a local *triage smell*, never a gate. | Correlation with real bugs ≈ 0.06 (Kendall); "adds little if any" beyond executable-line counts. [\[R2\]](#r2) |
| **SonarSource "Cognitive Complexity"** | **No incremental predictive value** over traditional measures. | Peer-reviewed JSS evaluation: "does not appear to fulfill the promise." [\[R3\]](#r3) |
| **SonarQube quality-gate severities** | **Weak, inconsistent, sometimes *inverted*.** Flagged "dirty" classes are no more fault-prone than clean ones. Useful as a cheap filter, **not** a quality score. | 33 Apache projects, ~27K faults. [\[R4\]](#r4) |
| **Mutation score** (as a single number) | **Poor *linear* proxy** (mostly a test-suite-size artifact) — **but** mutation testing is high-value as *guidance*: top-decile suites catch 8–46% more real faults. | ICSE 2018 (Papadakis et al.). [\[R5\]](#r5) |
| **Line-coverage % / LOC** | **Gameable.** High coverage with weak assertions is the canonical AI-slop hiding place; LOC measures size, not quality. | Corollary of the mutation and complexity findings above. |

**What survives as durable signal:** **ISO/IEC 25010:2023** [\[R1\]](#r1) maintainability — decomposed into *modularity, reusability, analyzability, modifiability, testability*, i.e. **low coupling + information hiding** — enforced as **architectural fitness functions** (import/layer boundaries), plus **strict typing**, **behavior-verifying tests validated by mutation testing**, **dependency integrity**, and **static analysis in the loop**.

> **Honesty note on the hype.** Several widely-quoted "AI slop" statistics **failed adversarial verification** during this document's research: the "~40% of Copilot code is vulnerable" figure, a "10× duplicate-block surge", and two GitClear copy/move percentages were all refuted — full list in [Appendix B.5](#b.5-what-was-refuted-the-verification-worked). **Judge on the structural signals below, not on alarm-bell numbers.** (Full caveats: §7.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. AI-specific slop failure modes → the control that neutralizes each

The [Secure AI-Assisted Development Standards §3](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md#3-the-problem-this-standard-attacks) names *five process failure modes* (intent drift, context rot, error accumulation, the speed–quality paradox, misplaced trust). This rubric maps the **code-outcome** failure modes those produce to a measurable control:

| AI slop failure mode | Evidence | The control (owner) |
|----|----|----|
| **Insecure code + overconfidence** | Stanford CCS'23: AI-assisted users wrote less-secure code, *more* confident it was secure. [\[R6\]](#r6) | Mandatory human review + blocking SAST that cannot be waived — **owned by SDS PW.7 + [AI companion §6.5/§6.6](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md)**. This rubric only *checks it is present*. |
| **Hallucinated / typosquatted dependencies** ("slopsquatting") | ~14.4% of *distinct* Python modules in real ChatGPT output did not exist. [\[R7\]](#r7) | Verify-before-add + hash-locked lockfile + new-import audit — **owned by [AI companion §6.4/§9](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md)**. This rubric *checks it is present*. |
| **Silent duplication over reuse** (copy-instead-of-abstract) | GitClear: 2024 was the first year copy/pasted lines (12.3%) exceeded "moved"/refactored lines (9.5%). [\[R9\]](#r9) *(Correlational — §7.)* | **Clone-detection on the diff** + a "moved vs copied" review lens. **New gate — this document (§5).** |
| **Shallow tests that assert little** | Coverage % hides assertion-free tests; mutation testing exposes them. [\[R5\]](#r5) | **Mutation testing on changed code, as guidance.** **New gate — this document (§5).** |
| **Unbounded complexity / over-abstraction** | Large, tangled units are a maintainability smell (though a weak *defect* predictor — §2). | **Advisory complexity triage** (surface, don't gate). **New gate — this document (§5).** |
| **Inconsistent conventions across a codebase** | Multi-session AI authorship drifts style/structure. | Broad lint ruleset + `CLAUDE.md` as the standing convention anchor. **Partly new (lint breadth) — §5.** |
| **Velocity ≠ delivered quality** | DORA 2024: AI adoption associated with ~7.2% lower delivery *stability* per 25% adoption. [\[R8\]](#r8) · [\[R10\]](#r10) *(Correlational, partly revised in 2025 — §7.)* | Small batch sizes + DORA change-fail/MTTR awareness. **Owned by [AI companion §3](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md).** |
| **Control-parity gap** (a guard on one path, missed on its sibling) | AI companion §6.6: an AI implements a control *where prompted* and misses its siblings — every confirmed medium-or-higher finding in the 2026-06 MEFOR audit had this shape. Real instance: the fail-closed leak gate guarded the *git-mirror* publish path but not its sibling, the *PyPI* publish path, so the sdist shipped private docs on every release. | **Enumerate sibling paths for every control; encode as one deterministic check where feasible.** Here → the published-artifact-integrity gate (**signal 6**). |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. The rubric — 11 signals that separate good code from slop

Each signal is a **risk → control → measure**, tagged by **gate type** (deterministic = machine-checked; advisory = human arbitrates) and by which document **owns** it. The signals fall into **two tiers** — weight them accordingly. **A codebase is certified "not slop" by the *composite*, never by any single row** (§2). Signals are numbered **contiguously by tier: Tier 1 = 1–6, Tier 2 = 7–11.**

**Tier 1 — Durable, high-signal controls (weight these most).** Structural, machine-enforceable properties where quality is *hard to fake* — the ones the evidence says actually predict maintainability and catch slop. These carry the verdict.

| \# | Signal | What "good" looks like | Gate type | Owner |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | **Enforced architecture boundaries** (ISO 25010 modularity / low coupling) | Import/layer rules are *machine-checked in CI*, not just documented | Deterministic | SDS PW.1–2; **checked here** |
| 2 | **Strict typing** | `mypy --strict`; suppressions carry error codes (no blanket ignores) | Deterministic | AI companion §6.5; **checked here** |
| 3 | **Tests verify behavior, not mocks** | Value/negative-path assertions; real integrations over mock choreography | Deterministic | SDS PW.8; **checked here** |
| 4 | **Dependency integrity** (anti-slopsquatting) | Existence-verify + hash-locked lockfile + new-import audit | Deterministic | **AI companion §6.4/§9** (pointer only) |
| 5 | **Security scanning + threat model** | Blocking SAST/SCA/secret-scan + written threat model + human review | Deterministic + advisory | **SDS PW.7 / AI companion §6.5–6.6** (pointer only) |
| 6 | **Published-artifact integrity** (supply-chain-*out*) | Published sdist/wheel ship **only intended content** — the package manifest is an *allowlist* (not a whole-repo sweep) + a fail-closed publish gate blocks any private/unintended file before the irreversible upload. Distinct from row 4's *incoming* dependency integrity | Deterministic | **This document — new** (+ SDS supply-chain) |

**Tier 2 — Measurement / lower-signal layer (guidance & triage — never a gate on their own).** Useful for *surfacing* problems, but each is a weak or gameable predictor in isolation (§2, §4.1), so they inform review — they do not certify quality.

| \# | Signal | What "good" looks like | Gate type | Owner |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 7 | **Test-signal proof** (mutation) | Mutation testing on changed code exposes shallow tests | Advisory (guidance) | **This document — new** |
| 8 | **Coverage visibility** | Coverage *measured on the diff* as guidance — never a whole-repo % gate | Advisory | **This document — new** |
| 9 | **Duplication / reuse discipline** | Clone-detection flags *new* duplication in diffs; justified parity whitelisted | Advisory | **This document — new** |
| 10 | **Lint breadth** (static analysis in the loop) | Broad ruleset (bugbear, comprehensions, simplify, pyupgrade, isort) | Deterministic | **This document — expand existing** |
| 11 | **Complexity as triage** (never a gate) | Advisory complexity signal surfaces the genuinely-large units | Advisory | **This document — new** |

> **Context caveat, not a signal — delivery stability (DORA).** "Velocity ≠ delivered quality" is a real AI-slop concern (DORA 2024 associated AI adoption with lower delivery *stability*), but it measures **delivery outcomes**, not whether a given diff is slop — a different altitude from the code-artifact signals above, on weaker (correlational, partly-revised — §7) evidence, and **owned by the [AI companion §3](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md)**. MEFOR's small-batch discipline (one coherent layer per commit) already covers the actionable part. It stays a §3 failure-mode entry, **not** a peer signal here.
>
> **Evidence & citations for the matrix.** Every signal and claim above maps to its supporting study in [**Appendix B.3**](#b.3-evidence-behind-each-rubric-element) (per-element evidence table), with full bibliographic citations in [**Appendix B.4**](#b.4-references), the derivation method in [**Appendix B.2**](#b.2-how-the-matrix-was-derived), and the claims that *failed* verification in [**Appendix B.5**](#b.5-what-was-refuted-the-verification-worked).

### 4.0 The liveness rule (hard) — a gate that cannot fail is not a control

**Every advisory gate must prove it measured something, or say why it could not.** A gate that reports
a conclusion without recording that it performed a measurement is indistinguishable from one that
worked, and it will stay that way indefinitely, because nobody investigates a green check.

This rule was written from failure, not theory. Three defects across **two** of this document's own
Tier 2 gates were found (2026-07-27) to have been green throughout: two gates measuring nothing (one
of them for two full versions of this rubric, during which it was scored ✅ **Built** here — v0.10),
and one gate that measured correctly but published a wrong derived number. Section 4.1 protects
against trusting a *number* too much; nothing protected against trusting a *green check that never
ran*. That is a distinct failure mode and it needs its own control:

1. **Proof of execution, not of findings.** The receipt counts units *examined* — files scanned,
   mutants processed, changed lines analysed — never units *found*. A clean codebase legitimately
   reports zero clones, and a liveness check that fires on good news gets muted, leaving the project
   worse off than before it existed.
2. **"Nothing to measure" is acceptable only when stated.** An explicit, reasoned declaration passes;
   a silent empty result fails. The two are visually identical, which is precisely why the reason is
   load-bearing.
3. **Reported numbers must reconcile against an INDEPENDENT source.** A gate can execute perfectly
   and still emit a wrong derived figure. Two rules, because the obvious one is weaker than it looks:
   parts must sum to the whole, each counted independently and never as a remainder (a remainder
   makes the sum true by construction); *and* any derived headline figure must be cross-checked
   against a second, independently produced measurement of the same quantity. A sum that includes a
   derived term can be algebraically blind to that term — ours was, and the blindness is now asserted
   by a test rather than assumed away.

Applies to any gate, in any project adopting this rubric — a deferred or advisory gate that silently
stops measuring is worse than an absent one, because the scorecard still counts it.

### 4.1 The anti-metric rule (hard)

**Do NOT certify quality — or fail a build — on any single one of:** line-coverage %, LOC, raw or cognitive cyclomatic complexity, or SonarQube severity counts. Each is a weak or gameable predictor (§2). They may be *surfaced as advisory triage signals*; they must never be *the* quality gate. This mirrors the AI companion's "gates are deterministic checks, never ask the model to be secure" — here: *a scoreboard is never the verdict.*

### 4.2 No validated single threshold (honest)

The literature validates that single metrics fail, but supplies **no validated numeric cutoff** for a combined scorecard. Thresholds (e.g. a mutation-score floor on changed code, a max new-clone count) are therefore **set empirically per project and recorded in the Appendix**, reviewed as data accumulates — not imported as universal constants. Where this document names a directional target, it is flagged as project-set, not evidence-certified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. The new measurement gates — placement (local vs CI) and status

The five gates this document adds (rubric rows 7–11) are *quality-measurement* gates. Placement follows the project's **three enforcement points** (identical to the AI companion §6.5): **pre-commit hook** (local), `messagefoundry check` (local + CI + IDE), and **GitHub Actions CI** (the authoritative gate, incl. self-hosted Windows runners).

| Gate | Cost | Recommended placement | Blocking? | Taxonomy |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Advisory complexity triage** (`C901` via ruff) | Cheap | CI advisory job | **Advisory only** (never a hard gate — §4.1) | ✅ **Built** — `quality-advisory.yml` (#1028) |
| **Clone-detection** (jscpd) | Cheap | CI advisory job; store-parity whitelisted | Advisory (finding, not fail) | ✅ **Built** — `quality-advisory.yml` (#1028) |
| **Diff-coverage visibility** (`diff-cover`) | Moderate | CI leg (reports on changed lines) | Advisory | ✅ **Built** — `quality-advisory.yml` (#1040; PR-only) |
| **Mutation testing** (`mutmut`, bounded scope) | **Cheap — measured** (461 mutants in 3s; mutmut 3 runs only the tests covering each mutant) | CI leg (advisory), **including PRs** + opt-in local command | Advisory (guidance) | ✅ **Built** — `quality-advisory.yml` (#1040; repaired 2026-07-27, see v0.10) |
| **Expand ruff ruleset** (`B, C4, SIM, UP, I`) | Cheap | The required CI `ruff check` leg | Blocking (from a clean baseline) | ✅ **Built** — `pyproject.toml` extend-select (#1047) |

**Answering "are these local?"** — Cheap gates (ruff breadth, `C901`) run **both** locally (pre-commit) and in CI. The expensive gates (mutation, clone, diff-coverage) are **CI-first** — they are too slow for the inner loop — but each is **exposable as an opt-in local command** so a maintainer can run it on demand. The *authoritative* enforcement is CI in every case; local runs are for fast feedback. This split is deliberate: it keeps the local edit-loop fast while the diff-scoped heavy analysis runs where wall-clock doesn't block the human.

> **All five measurement gates are now Built.** Complexity (11) and clone (9) shipped first (#1028), then diff-coverage (8) and mutation (7) (#1040) — non-required advisory jobs in [`quality-advisory.yml`](../.github/workflows/quality-advisory.yml) that can never block a merge — and finally the **ruff-breadth expansion (signal 10, \#1047)**, which unlike the others *is* enforced by the required `ruff check` leg (from a grandfathered clean baseline; new code must comply). Nothing remains designed-but-deferred.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. How this maps to the companion standards

| This rubric | Companion anchor |
|----|----|
| Rows 1–2 (structure, typing) | SDS **PW.1–PW.2** (secure design, modularity); AI companion **§6.5** (verification gates) |
| Row 3 (behavior-verifying tests) | SDS **PW.8** (test executable code) — *this rubric adds the quality bar on top of presence* |
| Row 4 (dependency integrity) | AI companion **§6.4 / §9** — *owned there; checked here* |
| Row 5 (security review + SAST) | SDS **PW.7**; AI companion **§6.5–6.6** — *owned there; checked here* |
| Row 6 (published-artifact integrity) | **New** — this document (+ SDS supply-chain) |
| Rows 7–11 (measurement gates) | **New** — 7/8/9/11 Built (advisory) in `quality-advisory.yml`; 10 Built + enforced by the required `ruff check` leg (#1047) |
| Delivery stability (DORA) — *context caveat, not a signal* (§4) | AI companion **§3** (the METR / DORA calibration) |
| The anti-metric rule (§4.1) | The quality-side analogue of AI companion **§5** "gates are deterministic checks, never ask the model to be secure" |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Evidence caveats (carry these into every use)

1.  **Metric-invalidation findings are robust** (peer-reviewed primary studies) but are *"this metric is weak alone"* results — they argue against **single-number gates**, not against measurement.
2.  **The GitClear duplication/churn trend is descriptively solid but the AI *causation* is correlational**, from a commercial vendor using a proprietary "moved" reuse heuristic, and confounded (2022–24 layoffs, a startup-growth effect). Treat the duplication *trend* as real; treat the AI attribution as interpretation.
3.  **Several AI-code findings are model-era-specific.** The Stanford security study used codex-davinci-002 (2022); the package-hallucination figures skew to GPT-3.5-era output. **Frontier models plausibly perform better — re-baseline periodically.**
4.  **The 14.4% Python hallucination figure is share of *distinct* modules**, not per-import rate (which is far lower — common modules are never hallucinated).
5.  **DORA 2024's negative delivery effect is associational** and was partly revised in DORA 2025.
6.  **No source provides a validated single-metric certification threshold** — the evidence supports composite, structural, guidance-based assessment (§4.2).

### A.1 Verdict

**A− / low slop-risk.** MEFOR implements **all six durable, high-signal controls** (rubric rows 1–6) as **Built**, and its *measurement* layer has now closed as well: **complexity (11) and clone (9)** shipped as advisory gates (#1028), then **mutation (7) and diff-coverage (8)** (#1040), and finally the **ruff-breadth expansion (#10)** (#1047, enforced by the required `ruff check` leg). So **all 11 signals are now Built**. It is strong where faking is hardest (machine-enforced structure) and thin only where the metrics are gameable anyway.

**The rubric earned its keep this cycle.** Applying **signal 6** (published-artifact integrity) surfaced a real **control-parity** gap (§3): the PyPI **sdist** was shipping the private security-posture docs on *every* release, because the fail-closed leak gate covered the git-mirror publish path but not its sibling, the PyPI path. It was fixed (#1020: a `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]` allowlist + a fail-closed "sdist is package-only" gate in `release.yml`) and **verified clean at v0.3.0**. That found-and-fixed leak is the one *durable*-control gap that has now closed; the rest of the gaps are all in the measurement layer.

### A.2 Scored signals (from the audit)

**Tier 1 — durable, high-signal controls (signals 1–6): all Built ✅.**

| \# | Signal | Status | Evidence in repo |
|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | Enforced architecture boundaries | ✅ **Built — Strong** | `tests/test_dependency_boundaries.py` AST-scans engine packages, blocks `fastapi`/`pyside6`/`api`/`console` imports, in the required CI `test` leg |
| 2 | Strict typing | ✅ **Built — Strong** | `[tool.mypy] strict = true`, dual-platform CI; all 33 `# type: ignore` + 100 `# noqa` carry rule codes; no blanket ignores |
| 3 | Tests verify behavior, not mocks | ✅ **Built — Strong** | 8,224 test functions across 546 files; ~11,300 value-`==` asserts; ~1,480 `pytest.raises`; **0** `assert_called*`; live SQL Server + Postgres integration legs |
| 4 | Dependency integrity | ✅ **Built — Strong** | Hash-locked `requirements.lock` (DEP-1 lock-sync + `--require-hashes` CI); pip-audit; `CLAUDE.md`/AI-companion verify-before-add rule |
| 5 | Security scanning + threat model | ✅ **Built — Strong** *(caveat A.4)* | 11 scanners (CodeQL, semgrep, bandit, gitleaks, pip-audit, crypto-inventory, forbidden-content, Trivy, Scorecard, zizmor, npm-audit); SECURITY.md (735 ln) + PHI.md (688 ln) |
| 6 | Published-artifact integrity (supply-chain-*out*) | ✅ **Built — found & fixed this cycle** | Was 🔴: the PyPI **sdist** swept the whole repo, shipping `docs/security/*`, `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/publish/*` on releases 0.1.0..0.2.15 (the mirror leak-gate never covered the PyPI path — a control-parity miss, §3). **Fixed \#1020:** `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist] only-include` + a fail-closed "sdist is package-only" gate in `release.yml`; **v0.3.0 verified package-only against the live PyPI artifact** (sha256 download). Historical 0.1.0..0.2.15 sdists remain public (owner-only PyPI deletion). |

**Tier 2 — measurement / lower-signal layer (signals 7–11): all 5 Built (#7, \#8, \#9, \#11 advisory; \#10 enforced).**

| \# | Signal | Status | Evidence in repo |
|----|----|----|----|
| 7 | Test-signal proof (mutation) | ✅ **Built (advisory)** — \#1040, **repaired 2026-07-27 (v0.10)** | `quality-advisory.yml` runs **`mutmut==3.6.0`** over one bounded, well-tested pure module (`parsing/binary.py` ↔ `test_binary_carriage.py`), on PRs + nightly cron + `workflow_dispatch`. **Measured: 461 mutants in 3s — 87 killed, 19 survived, 355 not covered by the scoped test.** Survivor table in the step summary. *Was scored Built on `mutmut<3` from 0.8 to 0.9 while producing nothing — see v0.10.* |
| 8 | Coverage visibility | ✅ **Built (advisory)** — \#1040, **surfaced 2026-07-27 (v0.10)** | `quality-advisory.yml` runs `pytest-cov` + `diff-cover` on the PR's changed lines (`--fail-under=0`), PR-only — coverage *of the diff*, never a whole-repo % gate (§4.1). Now emits **inline `::notice` annotations on the Files changed tab** (`--format github-annotations:notice`), adjacent uncovered lines coalesced into ranges. Advisory. |
| 9 | Duplication / reuse detection | ✅ **Built (advisory)** — \#1028 | `quality-advisory.yml` runs `jscpd` on `messagefoundry/`, whitelisting the ~21k-LOC justified store-backend parity (`sqlserver.py` / `postgres.py`); surfaces *un*justified copy-paste for triage, non-blocking |
| 10 | Lint breadth | ✅ **Built** — \#1047 | `[tool.ruff.lint] extend-select = ["B","C4","SIM","UP","I"]`, enforced by the required `ruff check` leg. B008 (FastAPI DI, ~460 hits) handled via `extend-immutable-calls` + a route-layer per-file ignore (real `x=list()` bugs still caught); **515 violations auto-fixed** (import sort, pyupgrade, safe simplify); **235 non-auto-fixable grandfathered** with per-line `# noqa` → clean baseline, new code must comply |
| 11 | Complexity triage | ✅ **Built (advisory)** — \#1028, **sharpened 2026-07-27 (v0.10)** | `quality-advisory.yml` runs `ruff --select C901 --exit-zero` (advisory, never gates), **plus a merge-base-vs-HEAD delta** (`scripts/quality/c901_delta.py`) that reports only functions a PR *introduced* or *made worse*. **Re-measured 2026-07-27: 122 functions exceed** `C901`**\>10** across 43 files (was 85 on 2026-07-13), complexity 11 / 14 median / 320 max. The raw list is unusable as a diff signal — all 122 findings anchor on a single `def` line — which is what the delta exists to fix |

### A.3 The gaps, ranked → buildable gates

Ordered by anti-slop leverage, not effort (build placement per §5). **✅ = shipped** (advisory; \#1028 or \#1040):

1.  **Mutation testing** — highest leverage; directly counters shallow-test slop, extra weight under the solo-maintainer review deviation (A.4). ✅ **shipped** (#1040 — `mutmut` over a bounded, well-tested module; runs on PRs + nightly cron + `workflow_dispatch`; widen the scope later). *(v0.11: was "mirror-nightly" — there is no mirror post-cutover, and the job no longer carries a repo-slug gate.)*
2.  **Clone-detection on diffs** — ✅ **shipped** (`jscpd`, store-parity whitelisted) — catches the copy-instead-of-abstract signature the parallel-worktree workflow is most exposed to.
3.  **Diff-coverage visibility** — measured on changed lines, guidance only (never a whole-repo % gate — §4.1). ✅ **shipped** (#1040 — `pytest-cov` + `diff-cover`, PR-only).
4.  **Advisory** `C901` **complexity** — ✅ **shipped** (advisory triage).
5.  **Expand ruff** `select` (`B, C4, SIM, UP, I`) — ✅ **shipped** (#1047 — extend-select enforced by the required `ruff check` leg; 515 auto-fixed, 235 grandfathered from a clean baseline).

*All gates are now shipped.* The ruff sweep (#10, \#1047) was run in a quiescent-worktree window (a 100+-file import sort would collide with in-flight parallel sessions) after pruning the stale worktrees to a minimal set. Mutation and diff-coverage were built *blind via CI* — verified by their own gate runs, since this repo's sessions can't stand up a local venv (see \#1040).

**Rollout record (measured 2026-07-13 — how the \#1047 sweep was executed):** `B,C4,SIM,UP,I` = **853 violations** (238 `B008` FastAPI false positives to exclude; 111 `I001` repo-wide import reorder); `C901` = **85 hits**. Safe rollout: (a) exclude framework-idiom rules (`B008` on `api/`); (b) **grandfather** the existing backlog so the *required* gate stays green (per-file-ignores / ratchet — new code only); (c) run the repo-wide import sort as a **dedicated pass when parallel worktrees are quiescent** — a 100+-file sweep conflicts with in-flight sessions; (d) keep `C901` **advisory**. (The built coverage/mutation gates install their tools from a **hash-pinned CI toolchain lock** — `pip install --require-hashes -r ci/locks/ci-quality.lock`, exported from `pyproject.toml`'s PEP 735 `[dependency-groups].ci-quality` — because a *version* pin alone does not satisfy Scorecard's `PinnedDependenciesID`. `pyproject.toml` therefore **did** change, and the lock sits **inside** the DEP-1 export machinery rather than beside it: a hash-pinned toolchain kept outside it rots into a pinned, stale, unpatched one. `requirements.lock` itself is unaffected.)

### A.4 Documented caveat — solo-maintainer review

Row 5's "human review" is **self-review** (the SDS §A.6 / [AI companion Appendix A.6](Secure_AI_Development_Standards.md#a6-documented-deviations) single-maintainer deviation). The Stanford overconfidence finding (§3) bites hardest exactly when the author reviews their own AI-authored code — which is the strongest argument for the mutation gate (Built this cycle — \#1040), since it is the one control that *adversarially* checks whether the tests assert anything, independent of the author's confidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Appendix B — The rubric matrix: methodology & cited references

*This appendix explains how to read the §4 signal matrix, how it was derived, and the evidence behind each element — with full citations. The §2, §3, and §4 tables link here.*

### B.1 What "the matrix" is and how to read it

The rubric's core is the **§4 matrix**: 11 signals, each a **risk → control → measure**, tagged by **gate type** (deterministic = machine-checked; advisory = human arbitrates) and by which document **owns** it. Read it as a **composite**, not a checklist of independent boxes:

- **Rows 1–6 are durable, high-signal controls** — enforced structure (ISO/IEC 25010 modularity), strict typing, behavior-verifying tests, dependency integrity, security scanning, and published-artifact integrity. These are where quality is *hard to fake*.
- **Rows 7–11 are the measurement / lower-signal layer** — mutation, coverage, clone-detection, lint breadth, complexity — useful as *guidance / triage*, never as a single gate.
- **The anti-metric rule (§4.1)** forbids certifying quality on any one number (coverage %, LOC, raw or cognitive complexity, SonarQube severity), because the evidence shows each is a weak or gameable predictor (B.3).
- **Delivery stability (DORA) is deliberately *not* a signal** — it measures delivery outcomes, not the code artifact, on weaker evidence; it is kept as a context caveat under the §4 table.

A codebase is judged "not slop" by the **composite** of the durable controls plus the guidance signals — with thresholds set **empirically per project** (§4.2), because no source validates a universal single-metric cutoff.

### B.2 How the matrix was derived

The matrix is **evidence-informed and adversarially verified**, not authored from opinion:

1.  **Adversarially-verified deep-research pass.** The question was decomposed into **five search angles** — (a) academic metric-validity, (b) quality frameworks & delivery metrics, (c) AI-slop empirical trends, (d) security & correctness studies, (e) practitioner controls. Parallel searches fanned out → ~24 sources fetched → ~109 candidate claims → the load-bearing ones put through **3-vote adversarial verification** (each verifier tried to *refute* the claim; ≥2 refutations killed it). Result: **20 confirmed, 5 refuted** (B.5). Only survivors entered the rubric.
2.  **Structural scaffold — ISO/IEC 25010:2023** [\[R1\]](#r1): the international product-quality model, whose *maintainability* characteristic (modularity, reusability, analyzability, modifiability, testability) supplies the "structure over scoreboards" backbone (signals 1–6).
3.  **The MEFOR scorecard (Appendix A)** is a separate, read-only audit of the actual repository — evidence, not estimates.
4.  **Honesty discipline (§7)** — every claim carries its limitation; correlational, vendor-sourced, and model-era-specific evidence is labelled as such.

### B.3 Evidence behind each rubric element

| Rubric element | What the evidence establishes | Reference |
|----|----|----|
| **Structure over scoreboards** (signals 1–6) | Product quality is dominated by *maintainability* = modularity / low coupling / information hiding — a structural property, not a metric score | [\[R1\]](#r1) ISO/IEC 25010:2023 |
| **Anti-metric rule (§4.1): raw complexity is weak** (bounds signal 11) | Cyclomatic / path / NPATH complexity correlate only weakly-to-moderately with real bugs; complexity is a *triage smell*, not a gate | [\[R2\]](#r2) Chen 2019 |
| **Anti-metric rule: Cognitive Complexity adds nothing** | SonarSource's Cognitive Complexity gives **no incremental** predictive value over traditional measures | [\[R3\]](#r3) Lavazza et al. 2023 |
| **Anti-metric rule: SonarQube severities are weak / inverted** | Over 33 Apache projects, "dirty" classes are **no more fault-prone** than clean ones; effects small, sometimes inverted | [\[R4\]](#r4) Lenarduzzi et al. 2020 |
| **Signal 7 — mutation as guidance** (why coverage % hides shallow tests) | Mutation *score* is a poor linear proxy (suite-size artifact), but top-decile suites catch **8–46% more real faults** — it exposes assertion-free tests that coverage % hides | [\[R5\]](#r5) Papadakis et al. 2018 |
| **Signal 5 / §3 — insecure code + overconfidence** (mandates human review) | AI-assistant users wrote **less-secure** code yet were **more confident** it was secure | [\[R6\]](#r6) Perry et al. 2023 |
| **Signal 4 — hallucinated dependencies** (slopsquatting) | LLM output frequently references **nonexistent packages** (~14.4% of distinct Python modules) → verify-before-add + hash-locked lockfile | [\[R7\]](#r7) Khanmohammadi et al. 2025 |
| **Signal 9 / §3 — silent duplication over reuse** | 2024 was the first year copy/pasted lines exceeded refactored ("moved") lines — the copy-instead-of-abstract signature *(vendor-sourced, correlational — §7)* | [\[R9\]](#r9) GitClear 2025 |
| **§3 — velocity ≠ delivered quality** (the DORA context caveat) | AI adoption associated with **lower delivery stability** (2024, correlational, partly revised); experienced devs measured **~19% slower** with early-2025 AI tooling | [\[R8\]](#r8) DORA 2024 · [\[R10\]](#r10) METR 2025 |

### B.5 What was refuted (the verification worked)

Five widely-circulated claims **failed** 3-vote adversarial verification and are **deliberately not** in the rubric — the filtering is part of the basis:

- **"~40% of GitHub Copilot programs contain security vulnerabilities."** An over-simplified reading of the NYU "Asleep at the Keyboard" study (Pearce et al., IEEE S&P 2022, arXiv:2108.09293); the headline percentage did not survive scrutiny. *(The study is real; the "40%" framing is not a supported rubric claim.)*
- **A "10× surge in duplicate blocks" (2022→2024)** — GitClear figure, refuted 0–3.
- **"Copy/pasted lines rose 8.3%→12.3% (~48%)"** and **"moved operations fell 17% (2021→2023)"** — GitClear / secondary-blog percentages that did not reconcile, refuted 0–3.

Because the refuted claims came mostly from the *AI-slop-trend* angle (vendor telemetry, secondary blogs), the rubric leans hardest on the **peer-reviewed metric-validity studies** (\[R2\]–\[R6\]) and treats the trend data (\[R8\], \[R9\], \[R10\]) as caveated context (§7).

### B.6 Caveats

The evidence caveats in **§7** are part of this appendix's basis: the metric-invalidation findings are robust peer-reviewed results, but they are "this-metric-is-weak-*alone*" results (they argue against single-number gates, not against measurement); the AI-slop trend data is correlational / vendor-sourced / model-era-specific; and no source supplies a validated single-metric certification threshold.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Version history

| Version | Date | Change |
|----|----|----|
| 0.11 | July 27, 2026 | **Added the liveness rule (new section 4.0) and built the control.** v0.10 recorded that signal 7 had been scored ✅ Built for two versions while its tool crashed before producing a mutant. That is a failure mode this rubric had no defence against: section 4.1 forbids over-trusting a *number*, but nothing forbade over-trusting a *green check that never ran* — and three defects across two of the five Tier 2 gates turned out to have that shape (two measuring nothing, one publishing a wrong derived number). Section 4.0 now requires every advisory gate to prove it measured something (units **examined**, never units found — a clean repo reports zero and must still pass) or to declare explicitly, with a reason, that it had nothing to measure; and any derived headline figure must be cross-checked against an independently produced measurement of the same quantity. Implemented as the `liveness` job in `quality-advisory.yml` — the only job there permitted to go red — with `tests/test_gate_liveness.py` replaying the historical incidents to prove the check catches them, and the good-news cases to prove it does not fire on them. **The control was itself adversarially reviewed before merge, and the review found it carrying the same weakness it was built to catch, in three places** — a dead coverage gate could pass by claiming "not applicable", an empty mutmut results file reported a flawless score, and the reconciliation sum was algebraically blind to the very count it claimed to protect. All three are fixed and regression-tested; rule 3 above was rewritten because of the third. No scoring change (A− stands); the gates were repaired in v0.10, this is the control that keeps them honest. |
| 0.10 | July 27, 2026 | **Restored to the repo, and corrected three claims that did not survive measurement.** This file had been absent from the repository's entire git history despite being cited by `quality-advisory.yml` and `pyproject.toml`; it is restored here from the maintained copy. Corrections, each measured rather than reasoned: **(a) Signal 7 was scored ✅ Built in 0.8 and 0.9 while producing nothing.** `mutmut<3` resolved to 2.5.1, which crashes on Python 3.14 in its pony-ORM cache (`cannot pickle 'itertools.count'`) *before generating a single mutant*; `\|\| true` made the job report success in 37s, so the gate looked green for two versions. Repaired on `mutmut==3.6.0` (+ `pytest-timeout`, and `source_paths` must be the package, not the one file, or the mutant copy cannot import `conftest`). Now genuinely measured: **461 mutants, 87 killed, 19 survived, 3 seconds** — so the "Expensive / never per-PR" cost model in §5 was also wrong, and mutation now runs on PRs. **(b) Signal 11's "85 functions over C901>10" is now 122 across 43 files**, and the raw list was found unusable as a diff signal (every finding anchors on one `def` line), so a merge-base delta was added that reports only PR-caused changes. **(c) Signal 8 now emits inline PR annotations** rather than console-only output. The A− verdict stands, but note that (a) is exactly the failure mode this rubric exists to catch — an advisory gate that reports success while measuring nothing — and it was caught by re-verification, not by the gate itself. |
| 0.9 | July 14, 2026 | **Restatused signal 10 (lint breadth) to ✅ Built — all 11 signals now Built.** The `extend-select = [B,C4,SIM,UP,I]` sweep shipped (#1047): B008 handled via `extend-immutable-calls` + a route-layer per-file ignore, 515 auto-fixed, 235 grandfathered with `# noqa`, enforced by the required `ruff check` leg. Flipped the exec verdict, §5 gate table + callout, §6 map, and Appendix A.1 / A.2 (row 10 + Tier-2 roll-up) / A.3 (gaps list + "remaining gate" prose → rollout *record*). No scoring change (A− stands). |
| 0.8 | July 14, 2026 | **Restatused signals 7 (mutation) + 8 (diff-coverage) to ✅ Built.** Both shipped as advisory jobs in `quality-advisory.yml` (#1040) — mutation over a bounded module (mirror-nightly + `workflow_dispatch`), diff-coverage on the diff's changed lines (PR-only). Flipped every place that called them deferred: the exec verdict, §5 gate table + callout, §6 map, and Appendix A.1 / A.2 (rows 7–8 + the Tier-2 roll-up) / A.3 (gaps list + DEP-1 note) / A.4. **Only signal 10 (lint breadth) remains designed-but-deferred → 10 of 11 signals now Built.** No scoring change (A− stands). |
| 0.7 | July 13, 2026 | **Tiered the Appendix A scorecard to match §4** — split A.2 into a Tier 1 table (durable, signals 1–6, all Built) and a Tier 2 table (measurement, signals 7–11), each with a per-tier status roll-up. Presentational only; no scoring change. |
| 0.6 | July 13, 2026 | **Renumbered signals contiguously by tier** (per owner): Tier 1 durable = **1–6** (published-artifact 11→6), Tier 2 measurement = **7–11** (mutation 6→7, coverage 7→8, clone 8→9, lint 9→10, complexity 10→11). Updated every cross-reference — §3, §4, §5, §6, exec summary, scope, and Appendix A.1 / A.2 (scorecard reordered) / A.3 / B.1 / B.2 / B.3. The `[R1]–[R10]` reference IDs are unchanged (they're citations, not signals). |
| 0.5 | July 13, 2026 | **Split the §4 matrix into two tiers** for clarity: **Tier 1 — durable, high-signal controls** (signals 1–5 + 11) and **Tier 2 — measurement / lower-signal layer** (signals 6–10). Signal numbers kept **stable** (they are IDs referenced across Appendix A + B), so grouped by tier rather than renumbered. No change to content, evidence, or the scorecard. |
| 0.4 | July 13, 2026 | **Added Appendix B — the rubric matrix's methodology & cited references** (B.1 how to read the matrix, B.2 derivation, B.3 per-element evidence map, B.4 full citations \[R1–R10\], B.5 the 5 refuted claims). **Annotated the rubric with links to it:** §2 + §3 evidence cells now carry `[Rn]` citation links, §4 has an evidence/citations pointer, and §8 points to the full bibliography. Fetched-verified author/title details for the academic references. |
| 0.3 | July 13, 2026 | **Built two gates + demoted DORA.** Complexity (signal 10) and clone (signal 8) shipped as advisory jobs in `quality-advisory.yml` (#1028) — scorecard restatused to ✅ Built (§5, A.2, A.3). **Demoted delivery-stability (DORA) from a peer signal to a context caveat** (it measures delivery outcomes, not the code artifact; weak/correlational evidence; owned by the AI companion) → back to **11 signals** (published-artifact renumbered 12→11). Mutation (#6) + diff-coverage (#7) deferred to a local-venv session; ruff-breadth (#9) to a quiescent-worktree sweep. |
| 0.2 | July 13, 2026 | Added **signal 12 — published-artifact integrity** (supply-chain-*out*) and the **control-parity** failure mode (§3), after the rubric's own application surfaced a private-doc leak in the published PyPI sdist (fixed \#1020, verified clean at v0.3.0 — Appendix A.1 + A.2 row 12). Scorecard refreshed (12 signals). |
| 0.1 | July 13, 2026 | Initial rubric. Evidence base from an adversarially-verified deep-research pass (20 confirmed / 5 refuted claims) + a read-only MEFOR code-quality audit. Establishes the anti-metric rule (§4.1), the 11-signal composite rubric (§4), the five new measurement gates with local-vs-CI placement (§5), and the MEFOR scorecard (Appendix A, verdict A−). Recorded as the third companion to the SDS + Secure AI-Assisted Development Standards. |
