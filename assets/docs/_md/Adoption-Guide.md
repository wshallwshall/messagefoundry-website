# MessageFoundry — Early-Adopter Installation & Rollout Guide

This guide is for teams piloting **MessageFoundry (MEFOR)** — an open-source, Python healthcare
interface engine — and taking it from a first install to full production use. It is an
**orchestration** document: it ties the existing docs together and adds the install-to-production
**rollout plan** that nothing else covers. Where a topic has a dedicated reference, this guide
links to it rather than repeating it.

> **Read this section first.** MessageFoundry is **pre-1.0** software. It does a small set of
> things well and production-grade today (see §2), and it has clearly-bounded areas that are
> **experimental or not yet built**. Any new interface engine — this one included — *will* have
> bugs you have not hit yet. The whole point of the staged rollout in §11 is to find them where
> they are cheap (a lab, a shadow feed) instead of where they are expensive (a production cut-over).
> If you adopt MEFOR, adopt the rollout discipline with it.

## 1. What MessageFoundry is, and who should pilot it

MessageFoundry routes, transforms, and validates messages between **Connections** — HL7 v2.x by
default, with payload-agnostic support for other formats — and its routing and handling are written in
**Python**. The runtime model is a graph wired by name:

- **Connection** — an endpoint that receives (inbound) or sends (outbound) messages (MLLP, TCP,
  File today; REST/SOAP/Database destinations and a Database poll source also ship — see
  [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md)).
- **Router** — a Python function bound to an inbound connection that decides which Handler(s) see
  each message.
- **Handler** — a Python function that filters → transforms a message and emits `Send`s to outbound
  connections.

The engine is a **headless asyncio service** (FastAPI/uvicorn) that owns a durable message store and
supervises one worker set per connection. A browser **web console** (`/ui`) and a **VS Code extension**
operate it over a localhost HTTP API. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full model.

**Who should pilot it now.** Teams who want a Python-native, open-source alternative to Mirth/Corepoint
and who are comfortable validating a pre-1.0 tool against their own traffic before trusting it. A single
engine node on a trusted network is the simplest pilot; **native TLS** (API + MLLP) and an opt-in
**active-passive failover** cluster on a shared server-DB store (PostgreSQL or SQL Server) are both built when you need them (see
§2/§6/§14). What is genuinely *not* there yet is MFA, off-box log shipping, and a de-identification
framework — track those items (§2) and pilot the parts that are ready. (Horizontal *active-active*
scale-out was dropped and is not a planned milestone; active-passive HA is the supported HA model.)

---

## 2. Maturity & honest limitations — read before you plan

MessageFoundry is solid for single-node production, and now also supports **opt-in active-passive
failover** (a leader/standby cluster on a shared server-DB store — PostgreSQL or SQL Server; §14). The authoritative
built-vs-roadmap references are [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and the README "Roadmap" section —
use the table below alongside them when planning.

### Built and production-ready

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Code-first Connection/Router/Handler graph | ✅ Built |
| **SQLite (WAL)** store backend | ✅ Production-ready — the default, single-node/dev |
| **PostgreSQL** store backend (single-node) | ✅ Production-ready — full staged pipeline, at-rest encryption, retention; single-node parity with SQLite |
| **Microsoft SQL Server** store backend (single-node) | ✅ Production-ready — full staged pipeline + response capture, at-rest encryption; needs the `sqlserver` extra + OS-level ODBC Driver 18. Engine-enforced retention/purge at full parity with SQLite; only WAL checkpoint / `VACUUM` / the DB-tier `.mfbak` snapshot are DBA-owned there. |
| Transactional staged queue (ingress→routed→outbound), at-least-once, dead-letter, replay | ✅ Built — see [ADR 0001](adr/0001-staged-pipeline-architecture.md) |
| Auth + RBAC + hash-chained audit log | ✅ Built — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) |
| At-rest body encryption (AES-256-GCM, opt-in) + key rotation | ✅ Built — see [PHI.md](PHI.md) |
| MLLP / TCP / File connectors; REST / SOAP / Database destinations; Database poll source | ✅ Built — see [CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md) |
| Validation & load tooling (`generate`, `check`, `dryrun`, the test harness, the load harness) | ✅ Built — see §8/§9 and [LOAD-TESTING.md](LOAD-TESTING.md) |
| Windows-service deployment via NSSM | ✅ Built — see [SERVICE.md](SERVICE.md) |
| **Native transport TLS** (API + MLLP) | ✅ Built — in-process API TLS (HTTPS/WSS) + per-connection MLLP-over-TLS, ≥TLS 1.2, opt-in mTLS, and a **fail-closed off-loopback bind guard** (a non-loopback bind without TLS is refused). Raw TCP/X12 stay plaintext (loopback/proxy). See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md). |
| **Native MFA** (TOTP, local accounts) | ✅ Built — RFC 6238 TOTP + single-use recovery codes; `[auth].require_mfa` enforces a second factor for local Administrators at the step-up boundary. AD/Entra users' MFA stays delegated to the IdP. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). |
| **Off-box log + audit forwarding** | ✅ Built — `[logging].forward_*` ships operational logs + PHI-redacted audit rows to a syslog/SIEM collector, over **native TLS** when you set `forward_protocol = "tls"` (RFC 5425, ADR 0080; port 6514, CA anchor via `forward_tls_*`). Residual: the transport **default** is UDP, so TLS is a per-deployment opt-in — set it, or front the collector with a local TLS-forwarding agent. See [PHI.md](PHI.md) §7. |
| **Active-passive HA / failover** | ✅ Built (Track B) — opt-in leader/standby cluster on a **shared server-DB** store (PostgreSQL or SQL Server): only the leader runs the graph, self-fencing leadership lease, immediate on-promotion recovery. Single-node stays the byte-identical default. See [CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md) + §14. |

### Experimental or not yet built — **do not depend on these for a production pilot**

| Capability | Status & implication |
|---|---|
| **Transport TLS for raw TCP / X12** | ❌ Not built — those two connectors are plaintext-only; keep them on loopback or front with a TLS-terminating proxy. (API + MLLP **do** have native TLS — see §6/[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).) |
| **`ack_after=delivered`** (defer the ACK until downstream delivery) | ❌ Not built — requesting it is rejected at config load. Only **ACK-on-receipt** exists, so a routing/transform/delivery failure happens **after** the sender was already told `AA` and will **not** NAK back. Operators rely on the message disposition + alerts, not the ACK. |
| **De-identification framework** | ❌ Not built. The AI assistant's `deidentified` scope falls back to `code_only`. |
| **In-place SQLite → server-DB migration** | ❌ Not built. Server-DB deployments are **greenfield only** — there is no automatic carry-over of SQLite history. Drain and cut over deliberately (§13). |
| **A throughput guarantee for your hardware** | ⚠️ By design. A baseline + tuning method is **published** ([TUNING-BASELINE.md](benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md), Gate #3) as a two-tier gate — host-independent **conformance** invariants (hard) + **performance** numbers *"as measured on the reference config"*. Because the durable-write path is hardware-dependent, those msg/s are not a promise for your box. **Measure on your own hardware** (§9). |

**The early-adopter bargain, stated plainly:** you get a durable engine with native TLS, real auth,
opt-in active-passive failover, and a real validation toolchain, in exchange for validating capacity on
your own hardware and supplying the operational pieces that aren't built yet (MFA, off-box logs,
de-identification). If that trade is acceptable, the rest of this guide is your playbook.

## 3. Prerequisites & environment checklist

Consolidate these before you install anything:

- [ ] **Python 3.14+** on the engine host.
- [ ] **OS:** Windows is the primary supported/serviced platform (NSSM); the engine itself is
      cross-platform Python.
- [ ] **Administrator/elevation** on the host if you will install the Windows service.
- [ ] **Outbound network access** for the service installer to download the SHA-256-pinned NSSM
      binary (or pre-stage NSSM on the host / on `PATH`).
- [ ] **Firewall plan:** open your inbound MLLP listener port(s) (the samples use e.g. `2575`/`2600`)
      to senders, and decide who may reach the **API on `127.0.0.1:8765`** (default loopback —
      keep it that way; see §6).
- [ ] **A writable data directory** for the store + logs (service default: `C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry`).
- [ ] **Backend decision (made here, not later):** **SQLite** (default, zero extra deps) for a
      single-node pilot, or a server DB — **PostgreSQL** (`messagefoundry[postgres]`, pure-Python) or
      **SQL Server** (`messagefoundry[sqlserver]` + OS-level ODBC Driver 18) — if you want a server
      store or a path toward DB-tier HA. See §2.
- [ ] If you will run the **cluster** path (active-passive failover):
      **NTP time sync** across nodes is a hard prerequisite, every node needs the **same config dir**, and
      `[store].backend = "postgres"` or `"sqlserver"`. (Single-node pilots skip this entirely; see §14.)
- [ ] A **PHI encryption key** plan (§6) and a **backup target + key-escrow** plan (§10) decided
      before any real data flows.

## 4. Installation

> **New here? Start with the [Installation Guide](INSTALL-GUIDE.md)** — the focused walkthrough of
> installing the engine and standing up your own private **config repo**, including running multiple
> instances from one repo. This section is the rollout-oriented summary of the same material.

Full reference: the **[Installation Guide](INSTALL-GUIDE.md)** and **[SERVICE.md](SERVICE.md)**. The essentials:

### 4.1 Install the engine

MessageFoundry is a **read-only, version-pinned dependency**
([ADR 0017](adr/0017-consumer-deployment-model.md)): install a published wheel and **pin the exact
version**, the same way you pin any other production dependency. Create a venv and install:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install "messagefoundry==0.3.2"        # pin the exact engine version (core runtime only)
```

`messagefoundry==0.3.2` pulls only the **core runtime** — what a headless engine needs. Add extras
(§4.2) for the PySide6 test harness, a server-DB backend, or SFTP; the browser web console installs
as its own `messagefoundry-webconsole` wheel.

> ⚠️ **Early access.** MessageFoundry is in **Early Access** on public PyPI — feature-complete and
> test-validated, but the independent external review and penetration test that ASVS
> recommends at Level 3 have not yet been performed. Pin the version you have qualified;
> check [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/messagefoundry/) for the current release. You can
> equally install from your organization's **private index**.

**Verify the release before you install.** MessageFoundry ships one signed wheel to many PHI-bearing
instances, so verify the artifact's provenance *before* installing — pinning a version (or a hash) proves
you got a *fixed* file, not that it is the one MessageFoundry built. Every release carries **SLSA build
provenance** and a **Sigstore signature**; check both with the **GitHub CLI** (`gh` ≥ 2.49), and
optionally `sigstore` (`pip install sigstore`). Install **only** the file that passes:

```powershell
$V = "0.3.2"   # the version you intend to install — see PyPI for the current release

# Download the wheel + its Sigstore bundle from that release's assets
gh release download "v$V" --repo MEFORORG/MessageFoundry `
  --pattern "messagefoundry-$V-*.whl" --pattern "messagefoundry-$V-*.whl.sigstore*"

# Verify SLSA build provenance:  artifact -> source commit -> builder workflow
gh attestation verify "messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl" --repo MEFORORG/MessageFoundry

# (defense in depth) Verify the Sigstore signature pins the release workflow identity
python -m sigstore verify identity "messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl" `
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v$V" `
  --cert-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

# Only if BOTH pass, install the exact file you verified
pip install ".\messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl"
```

The same attestation also covers the **public PyPI** copy (it is byte-identical), so you can
`pip download "messagefoundry==$V" --no-deps -d .\verify`, `gh attestation verify` the
downloaded wheel, then `pip install --no-index --find-links .\verify "messagefoundry==$V"`. A
registry/mirror substitution or a relabelled file **fails** the check. (The `--cert-identity` ref must
match the tag you install — e.g. `refs/tags/v0.3.2` for that release.)

For a **reproducible pinned** deploy, generate a hash-locked requirements file scoped to the extras you
actually run and install it with `--require-hashes`. The scaffolded config repo (`messagefoundry init`,
below) already pins the engine in its `requirements.txt` — extend that into a full hash-lock for your
host.

### 4.2 Optional extras

| Extra | Pulls in | When |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `asyncpg` (no OS dep; ships compiled wheels) | Using the PostgreSQL backend (recommended prod path) |
| `console` | PySide6 + keyring | Running the desktop admin console |
| `sftp` | paramiko | SFTP connectors |
| `sqlserver` | `aioodbc` **+ OS-level Microsoft ODBC Driver 18** | The SQL Server *store* backend (`backend=sqlserver`, production) and the DATABASE connector family. |
| `dev` | pytest/ruff/mypy/httpx | Development & CI |

> ⚠️ There is **no friendly preflight** for the `postgres` extra: if you set `backend=postgres` but
> forgot `pip install 'messagefoundry[postgres]'`, you get a raw `ImportError` at startup instead of a
> clear message. Install the extra with the backend.

### Start your own config repo (`messagefoundry init`)

§4.1 installed the **engine**. Now scaffold the other half a deploying organization owns — your **own**
separately-versioned **config repo** ([ADR 0017](adr/0017-consumer-deployment-model.md)) — which holds
your Connections/Routers/Handlers and drives one or more engine instances. **This is the recommended way
to run MessageFoundry:** the `samples/` directory used in older quickstarts ships only in a source
checkout, **not in the installed wheel**, so a wheel install runs against *your* `config/`, not
`samples/`.

```powershell
messagefoundry init ./my-config-repo
```

It writes a runnable starter feed (`config/`), `environments/<env>.toml` value stubs, a synthetic
fixture, an instance `messagefoundry.toml` (active environment + posture), a `requirements.txt` pinning
this engine version, a CI `check` workflow, and `.vscode` settings — so `messagefoundry check --config
config --messages messages/sets` is green from the first commit. See the generated `README.md` for the
day-to-day workflow.

### 4.3 Run it (foreground, to learn the ropes)

From your config repo (the one `messagefoundry init` created), run the engine against its `config/`
directory:

```powershell
cd ./my-config-repo
python -m messagefoundry serve --config config --db ./messagefoundry.db --env dev
```

`serve` flags and their precedence (**CLI > `MEFOR_<SECTION>_<KEY>` env > `messagefoundry.toml` >
built-in default**): `--config` (your graph directory — pass `--config config` for a scaffolded repo;
the built-in default `samples/config` exists only in a source checkout), `--service-config` (default
`./messagefoundry.toml` if present), `--db`, `--host`, `--port`, `--log-level`, `--env`
(a **free-form** environment name, ADR 0017), `--allow-insecure-bind`.

> ⚠️ **The active environment is required.** `serve` refuses to start (exit 2) without `--env <name>`
> (or `[ai].environment`) — there is no silent `prod` default, so a missing env can never resolve
> another environment's values/secrets. Built-in names `dev`/`staging`/`prod` carry a default posture;
> a custom name (e.g. `test`, `poc`) also needs `[ai].data_class` + `[ai].production`. The active
> environment is logged at startup.

> 🔑 **`dev` now carries the PHI posture ([ADR 0148](adr/0148-phi-default-posture-and-an-explicit-security-enforcement-level.md)) — provide a store key or declare synthetic.**
> Since ADR 0148 (GIVEN 1) the built-in `dev` env derives the **PHI** data-class, so your first run exercises
> the same at-rest-encryption path production uses (rather than first meeting it in prod). `serve --env dev`
> therefore **refuses to start (exit 2) without a store encryption key**. Two ways forward for a local run:
> - **Recommended — mint a throwaway dev key** (exercises the real encryption path): run `messagefoundry
>   gen-key` and set the printed base64 value as `MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (a dev key is fine; **never
>   commit it**).
> - **Genuinely no-PHI box** — declare it synthetic: set `[security].handles_real_patient_data = false` (a
>   loud, audited opt-out) to run **key-free**, for a dev/CI box that only ever processes synthetic HL7.
>
> The refuse/warn severity of the PHI serve-gate ladder is the `[security].enforcement` dial (default
> `enforce`, byte-identical to the former production behaviour). On a **loopback** dev bind you hit only the
> keyless-PHI refusal above — the off-loopback exposure rungs (TLS, MFA-at-exposure, …) need a non-loopback
> bind. Set `[security].enforcement = warn` to downgrade the PHI refusals to loud, audited warnings during
> local bring-up.

### 4.4 Run it as a Windows service (the supported production run-mode)

Use the elevated installer; install under a **least-privilege virtual account** rather than the
default LocalSystem:

```powershell
# from an elevated shell
scripts\service\install-service.ps1 -ServiceAccount "NT SERVICE\MessageFoundry"
```

The installer is idempotent, auto-downloads a SHA-256-pinned NSSM, bakes absolute `serve` paths into
the service, and (with `-ServiceAccount`) auto-grants config-read + data-dir-read/write to the
account. Service defaults: name `MessageFoundry`, data dir `C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry`, store
`<DataDir>\messagefoundry.db`, logs `<DataDir>\logs`, bind `127.0.0.1:8765`.

> ⚠️ **Pinned-wheel operational model.** With a pinned-version install (§4.1), the running service
> loads the **installed wheel** — a known, pinned version, not a moving checkout. Picking up a new
> engine version is a deliberate `pip install "messagefoundry==<new>"` + NSSM restart (§13), so every
> upgrade is an explicit, reviewable act. *(A contributor running the **editable** install instead
> serves whatever branch is checked out — treat that checkout as the release artifact; see §13.)*

### 4.5 First-run admin bootstrap

Auth is **enabled by default**. On the first start against an empty store, MEFOR creates a one-time
bootstrap admin (`admin`) and writes its password to an **owner-only `bootstrap-admin.txt`** next to
the store (only the file *location* is logged — never the password). Then:

1. Log in as `admin`; you are **forced to change the password** on first use.
2. **Create a second real administrator** promptly.
3. **Delete `bootstrap-admin.txt`.**

The bootstrap account auto-retires once a second admin exists, or — while still unclaimed — 72h after
creation.

### 4.6 Verify it runs

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health           # -> {"status":"ok"}
# tail <DataDir>\logs\service.out.log for the "wiring started" banner
```

Then send a synthetic message to confirm the end-to-end path. The scaffolded starter feed listens on
MLLP `2575` and ships a PHI-free fixture at `messages/sets/example_adt.hl7` — send it with any MLLP
client. The convenience senders (`samples/send_mllp.py`, `python -m harness`) ship with the **engine
source checkout**, not the installed wheel; from a checkout you can run:

```powershell
python samples/send_mllp.py samples/messages/adt_a01.hl7
```

If start fails, check `service.err.log` first — the common causes are relative paths resolving to the
system dir under a service account, a busy MLLP/API port, or a data dir the account can't write.

---

## 5. Minimum viable configuration

Full reference: **[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)** (service settings) and
**[CONNECTIONS.md](CONNECTIONS.md)** (the graph).

There are two distinct configuration surfaces:

1. **The message graph (Python modules)** in your `--config` directory. The minimum first flow is
   one module: an `inbound()` with a transport spec and a `router=` binding, a `@router` that returns
   handler name(s), and a `@handler` that returns `Send(...)` to a declared `outbound()`. The scaffolded
   repo (`messagefoundry init`, §4) gives you a working `config/IB_EXAMPLE_ADT.py` to start from (or,
   from a source checkout, copy `samples/config/IB_ACME_ADT.py`). The loader globs `*.py` (non-recursive;
   skips `_*`-prefixed helper files), then merges an optional `connections.toml`.
2. **Service/operational settings** in `messagefoundry.toml` (+ `MEFOR_*` env + CLI). Keep **all
   secrets out of this file and out of source control** — supply them via `MEFOR_<SECTION>_<KEY>` env
   vars (the loader *warns* if it sees a known secret in the file).

Guidance for a clean first flow:

- **Use the MLLP/File pair** for an initial end-to-end test — both are fully built and need no extras.
  The Database connector family is production-supported but adds the `[sqlserver]` extra + ODBC Driver
  18; MLLP/File keep the first hop dependency-free.
- **Never set a host on an inbound MLLP/TCP connection** (it is a config error). Set the listen
  interface once, service-side, via `[inbound].bind_host` (loopback for dev; a specific NIC behind a
  firewall for prod). Outbound MLLP/TCP *do* take the downstream host.
- **Author anything environment-specific as `env("key")`**, put non-secret values in
  `environments/dev.toml` / `environments/prod.toml` with identical keys, and inject secrets only via
  `MEFOR_VALUE_<KEY>`. A referenced-but-undefined key fails loud at load. Use `current_environment()`
  (not `env()`) inside a handler to branch on the deployment.
- **`connections.toml` (data) is optional** ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-gui-manageable-connections-toml.md)):
  move *transport config* there if you want hand/GUI editing; keep *logic* (routers/handlers) in `.py`.
  A name declared in both a module and `connections.toml` is a hard error (no silent shadowing).
- **The `--config` directory is a trust boundary.** `serve` and `POST /config/reload` **execute** the
  Python in it, in-process, as the service account. On POSIX the loader refuses a group/world-writable
  config dir; **on Windows this is your responsibility** — lock the directory's ACL to admins + the
  service account.

---

## 6. Security & PHI hardening before real data

Full references: **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**, **[PHI.md](PHI.md)**, and **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**
(network exposure). MEFOR ships real auth, RBAC, audit, opt-in at-rest encryption, and **native TLS**
(API + MLLP, with a fail-closed off-loopback bind guard); the remaining transport gaps are **MFA** and
**off-box log shipping**. Complete this checklist **before any real PHI flows**:

- [ ] **API off-loopback requires native TLS.** The API binds `127.0.0.1` by default. To reach it from
      another host, configure **in-process TLS** (`[api].tls_cert_file` + `[api].tls_key_file`,
      `tls_min_version` ≥ 1.2, opt-in mTLS via `tls_client_ca_file`) **or** front it with a TLS terminator
      (`[api].tls_terminated_upstream = true` + `[api].trusted_proxies`). A non-loopback bind **without**
      TLS (or a trusted terminator) is **refused at startup**. **Never use `--allow-insecure-bind` for
      real PHI** — it is a loud dev-only escape that puts bearer tokens and PHI on the wire in cleartext.
      (With auth disabled, a non-loopback bind is refused unconditionally.)
- [ ] **MLLP off-loopback requires native TLS too.** MLLP-over-TLS is built: set `tls = true` +
      `tls_cert_file`/`tls_key_file` per connection (opt-in mTLS via `tls_ca_file`; ≥ TLS 1.2). MLLP is
      **plaintext by default**, and a non-loopback plaintext MLLP bind is refused. **Raw TCP and X12 have
      no transport TLS** — keep them on a trusted segment or proxy-terminate. Full matrix:
      [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).
- [ ] **Turn on at-rest encryption and make it mandatory:** mint a key with `messagefoundry gen-key`
      (or a Windows DPAPI-protected key file via `messagefoundry protect-key`), set
      `MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, **and** set `[store].require_encryption = true` so the engine
      refuses to start unencrypted.
- [ ] **Enable volume encryption (BitLocker/LUKS).** App-level encryption protects message *bodies*;
      the `summary` / `control_id` / `message_type` columns and the `-wal`/`-shm`/temp files are **not**
      app-encrypted and rely on volume encryption.
- [ ] **Run under a least-privilege account** (the virtual account from §4.4) and lock down the store
      directory and any File-connector spill directories. **Treat backups as PHI.**
- [ ] **Finish the bootstrap-admin handoff** (§4.5): change the password, create a second admin,
      delete `bootstrap-admin.txt`.
- [ ] **For Active Directory:** use **LDAPS** with a trusted CA, never set `MEFOR_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS`
      in production, and configure the directory's lockout/complexity policy (the engine's account
      lockout covers local accounts only). AD/Entra MFA is enforced by your directory; **local
      accounts** use the engine's **native TOTP MFA** (`[auth].require_mfa`, WP-14) — enable it before
      an off-loopback PHI exposure.
- [ ] **Populate the fail-closed `[egress]` allowlist** (it defaults to unrestricted) for REST/Database
      destinations.
- [ ] **Keep logging at `INFO` or above** and `expose_docs` off in production. Full payloads are never
      logged at INFO+ by design, but PHI-log-redaction of chained-exception traceback text is not yet
      fully closed — **do not raise the service to DEBUG with real PHI**.
- [ ] **Author routers/handlers so they never interpolate raw HL7 into an exception message** (it can
      surface in `last_error`/`detail`).
- [ ] Run **`messagefoundry audit-verify`** periodically (the audit log is tamper-*evident*, not
      tamper-*proof*), and set `[retention]` windows — they are **off by default (kept forever)**.

---

## 7. Reliability configuration — how nothing gets lost

This is the heart of operating a new tool safely. The durability model is a **transactional staged
queue** (no external broker): each message flows ingress → routed → outbound, with every handoff a
single committed transaction, giving **at-least-once** delivery with crash-safe re-runs. Details in
[ADR 0001](adr/0001-staged-pipeline-architecture.md).

Key semantics to internalize:

- **ACK-on-receipt.** The sender is `AA`'d as soon as the raw message is durably committed (after
  synchronous decode/parse/optional strict-validate, which still NAK). **Any routing/transform/delivery
  failure happens *after* the ACK** and surfaces as an internal **disposition + alert**, never a NAK.
  Operators monitor disposition + alerts, **not** the ACK, for post-ingress failures.
- **Disposition lifecycle:** `RECEIVED` → `ROUTED`/`UNROUTED` → `PROCESSED`/`FILTERED`/`ERROR`. The
  store finalizer is the **sole authority** and never finalizes while any stage row is still in flight.
  Note: a single dead row at *any* stage flips the whole message to `ERROR` **even if a sibling handler
  delivered** — so read the **per-message event trail**, not just the headline status.
- **Failure classification & policy (per outbound):**
  - Permanent partner reject (`AR`/`CR`) → **dead-letter immediately** (still replayable).
  - Transient (`AE`/`CE`) or transport error → **retry per `RetryPolicy`**.
  - Internal/code error → either **STOP** the lane and raise a `connection_stopped` alert, or
    **CONTINUE** (auto-dead-letter the bad message and keep flowing).
  - **`RetryPolicy.max_attempts` unset = retry forever** (nothing silently lost) with exponential
    backoff. Under the default **FIFO** ordering, a permanently-failing head **blocks its lane** until
    it succeeds or is purged.

**Mandatory before go-live:**

- [ ] **Wire real alerts.** Configure the `[alerts]` **webhook and/or email** notifier — do **not**
      rely on the default logging-only sink. The conservative defaults (FIFO head-of-line blocking,
      retry-forever, STOP-on-internal-error) are only safe if a human gets paged when a lane stalls.
- [ ] **Set `[delivery]` buildup thresholds** (`max_oldest_seconds` defaults to 300s; set a `max_depth`
      sized to each connection's throughput) so `queue_buildup` fires before a stuck lane silently
      backs up. Buildup detection now covers the ingress and routed stages too, not just outbound.
- [ ] **Choose `RetryPolicy` per outbound deliberately:** retry-forever for partners that must never
      lose a message (accept head-of-line blocking + rely on buildup alerts), or a finite `max_attempts`
      where stale data is worse than a replayable dead-letter.
- [ ] **Choose `InternalErrorPolicy` intentionally:** `CONTINUE` (default) for high-volume feeds where
      uptime matters most; `STOP` for low-volume feeds where ordering/no-loss matters more than uptime.
- [ ] **Code routers/handlers as pure and idempotent.** At-least-once means a message can re-run after
      a crash or a replay. No side-effecting writes mid-transform; the **one** allowed exception is a
      **live, read-only DB lookup**. Downstream connectors/partners must **dedupe** (e.g. on MSH control id).

Recovery tools you should know cold: **`/dead-letters`** (triage) + **`/dead-letters/replay`** (bulk
*outbound* recovery), and per-message **`/messages/{id}/replay`** (for dead ingress/routed rows —
router/transform errors, undecryptable raw, a removed handler). Startup automatically returns stale
in-flight rows to pending (crash recovery) and dead-letters rows whose destination/handler left the
config.

---

## 8. Pre-traffic validation

Prove correctness **before** any network traffic. None of this should ever run against real PHI —
`generate`/`dryrun` can emit full message bodies; never redirect their output to a committed file or
CI log.

1. **Build a synthetic corpus:** `messagefoundry generate --type ADT --count 50 --out <fixtures>`
   (conformant HL7 v2.5.1, validated against hl7apy; 13 message types, 57 ADT triggers; PHI-free).
2. **Gate the config in CI / a pre-commit hook:**
   `messagefoundry check --config <dir> --messages <fixtures>`.
   - `validate` (every module loads; every inbound→router reference resolves; no port collisions) is
     **required and blocking**.
   - `dryrun` is **required only when you supply a fixtures dir containing `*.hl7`** — **without
     fixtures the dryrun is silently skipped** and the gate passes on `validate` alone, so a
     transform that errors at runtime is *not* caught. **Build and maintain the fixtures.**
   - `ruff`/`mypy` are advisory (never block).
3. **Inspect the wiring:** `messagefoundry validate --json` (all problems at once) and
   `messagefoundry graph --config <dir>` (confirm the wired graph matches intent).
4. **Confirm dispositions:** `messagefoundry dryrun` runs the same core the live engine runs (no I/O),
   so dry-run and live route identically. Then exercise the **test harness** (`harness/`): its 5
   headless `--scenario` runs (`processed`/`filtered`/`unrouted`/`error`/`dead_letter`) assert
   dispositions over the API for CI, and its GUI can inject delivery faults (delay-then-AA, close,
   fail-N-then-AA) to prove your **retry / dead-letter / replay** behavior before you trust it.

Note: `validate` only catches **literal** port collisions; `env()`-resolved ports are checked at bind
time. A `prod`-only missing `env()` value may not surface during a `dev`-context check — validate
against the target environment before promoting.

---

## 9. Capacity & load testing on *your* hardware

Full references: **[LOAD-TESTING.md](LOAD-TESTING.md)** and the published
**[throughput baseline & tuning reference](benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md)** (Gate #3) — a **two-tier
gate**: host-independent **conformance** invariants (zero loss, bounded drain, low error rate — a hard
release blocker) plus **performance** numbers *"as measured on the reference config"*. Because the
durable-write path is hardware-dependent, those msg/s figures are **not** a promise for your box —
establish your own baseline.

The headless load harness (`harness/load/`) drives an already-running engine over real MLLP and the
HTTP API (it never touches the store), so it is **store-agnostic** — swap the engine's `--db` to
compare SQLite vs Postgres ceilings on identical traffic.

Recommended ramp:

1. **`smoke`** — tiny zero-loss wiring check (no performance claim).
2. **`fanout-baseline`** — warmup → ramp → sustained → spike → recovery; SLOs are evaluated only on the
   measured sustained phases. Reference targets in the profile: ≥200 msg/s sustained, ACK p99 ≤50ms,
   e2e p99 ≤5s, error ≤0.001, drain ≤60s, zero-loss.
3. **`soak`** — ~1-hour steady state watching DB/WAL growth + dead-letter accumulation.

Treat the **zero-loss reconciliation** (`sent == engine_read`, `sink_received == engine_written`,
backlog drained to zero) as the **headline gate** — throughput numbers are meaningless if messages
were lost. Use a **closed-loop** phase (fixed concurrency) to find your true max sustainable
throughput, and the `slow` transform mode to find your per-core transform ceiling. Save the JSON/CSV
reports and use `--baseline` + `--tolerance` to catch regressions over time. Size `correlator_capacity`
above your peak in-flight (watch for correlation-miss notes), and remember a single Python sender
process is the offer ceiling — shard it across processes if it can't saturate your engine.

**Sizing reality:** the staged pipeline has ~**3× write-amplification** on SQLite (3 commits for a
common single-handler message; 2 + H for an H-way fan-out) — see
[the write-amplification benchmark](benchmarks/step-b-write-amplification.md). Plan disk headroom for
`.db` + `-wal`, plan retention/VACUUM (§10), and move to **Postgres** if a single-writer SQLite ceiling
becomes the bottleneck.

---

## 10. Backup, restore & disaster recovery

> **No existing repo doc covers this** — it is part of *your* operational responsibility. Rehearse a
> full restore before you carry real data.

**Back up the store.**

- **SQLite:** the WAL backend means three files must be captured **consistently** — `.db`, `.db-wal`,
  `.db-shm`. Use `sqlite3 <db> ".backup '<dest>'"` against the live DB, or take a **quiesced cold copy**
  (graceful stop → copy → restart). A naive copy of just the `.db` while the service runs can be
  inconsistent.
- **PostgreSQL:** use your standard DB backups — `pg_dump` for logical backups and/or WAL archiving /
  PITR for point-in-time recovery. The engine is greenfield-only on server DBs, so the DB tier owns
  store-level DR here.

**Escrow the encryption key SEPARATELY.** If you enabled at-rest encryption (§6), a restored store is
**unreadable without the same `MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / DPAPI key file**. Back the key up in a
different location/system from the data, with its own access control.

**Restore-and-verify drill (do this in the lab, §11 Stage 0):** restore the store + key into a clean
host, start the engine, confirm `/health`, run `/status/integrity-check` (SQLite `PRAGMA quick_check`),
and spot-check `/messages` and dispositions.

**Keep the store bounded.** `[retention]` is **off by default (kept forever)**. Set `max_db_mb` (drives
a `storage_threshold` alert), `messages_days` / `dead_letter_days` (body purge), and the daily VACUUM
so the store doesn't grow unbounded and a full disk doesn't take you down mid-pilot.

---

## 11. Staged rollout plan with go/no-go gates

This is the recommended path from first install to full production. **Do not skip stages** — each one
exists to catch a different class of problem cheaply. Advance only when the stage's **exit criteria**
are met.

### Stage 0 — Lab / standalone

**Goal:** prove wiring, dispositions, and recovery on a throwaway box, with **synthetic data only**.

**Setup:** SQLite, loopback, auth on, a synthetic corpus from `messagefoundry generate`.

**Exit criteria (→ Stage 1):**
- [ ] `messagefoundry check --config <dir> --messages <fixtures>` exits 0 (validate **and** dryrun green).
- [ ] All 5 disposition `--scenario` runs pass (`processed`/`filtered`/`unrouted`/`error`/`dead_letter`).
- [ ] You have driven a retry → dead-letter → **replay** cycle via the harness fault injection and
      understand the recovery tools (§7).
- [ ] A **backup + restore** has been rehearsed once (§10).

### Stage 1 — Shadow / parallel run

**Goal:** run MEFOR alongside your **incumbent** engine on **real production traffic** without
affecting any downstream system.

**How:** tee/duplicate the production **inbound** feed to a MEFOR instance whose outbounds point at a
**throwaway/null sink** (the harness correlation sink works well), or use a router that `Send`s only to
a dedicated "shadow" outbound. Compare MEFOR's dispositions and transformed output against the
incumbent's outcomes for the same messages.

> ⚠️ **Do not dual-*write* to real partners in shadow.** At-least-once + non-idempotent downstreams
> make a true dual-write dangerous. Keep shadow outbounds pointed at a sink unless the partner dedupes.

**Exit criteria (→ Stage 2):**
- [ ] **Zero-loss reconciliation holds** over a sustained window (e.g. 1–2 weeks) at production volume.
- [ ] MEFOR dispositions/output **match the incumbent's** for the same messages (differences explained).
- [ ] **No unexplained dead-letters**; every `ERROR` understood.
- [ ] A load test on **production-like hardware** meets your own SLO targets (§9).

### Stage 2 — Limited production

**Goal:** MEFOR becomes the system of record for a **small, low-risk subset** of real feeds (one
partner / one low-volume interface).

**Prereqs:** switch to **Postgres (single-node)** if you need a server DB; **encryption on**
(`require_encryption=true`); **alerts wired** and **monitoring in place** (§12); **backups automated**;
**upgrade + rollback runbook validated on staging** (§13).

**Exit criteria (→ Stage 3):**
- [ ] e2e p99 within your SLO; **zero unexplained dead-letters** over the observation window.
- [ ] **Alert wiring proven by a deliberate fault-injection drill** — you triggered `queue_buildup` /
      `connection_stopped` and the on-call was actually paged.
- [ ] **Backup + restore rehearsed against the production store** (not just the lab copy).
- [ ] Rollback runbook exercised at least once.

### Stage 3 — Full production

**Goal:** migrate the remaining feeds **in waves** (never big-bang). Keep decommissioning the incumbent
as a **separate, later** step so you retain a fallback.

**Steady-state expectations:**
- [ ] Sustained-load SLO met on production hardware.
- [ ] DR (backup/restore) rehearsed and scheduled.
- [ ] On-call + the failure-drill runbook (§12) in place.
- [ ] If you require HA: stand up the built **active-passive** cluster (leader/standby on a shared
      server-DB store — PostgreSQL or SQL Server) via the **§14 HA rollout runbook** — VIP standup +
      both failover drills passed — and keep HA at the DB tier too. Decided and rehearsed before you
      depend on it.

---

## 12. Day-2 operations & monitoring

**Verify-it-runs (after every start/restart):** `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok"}`, send a synthetic
message, and confirm the **"wiring started"** banner in `service.out.log`.

**Monitoring surfaces (poll the API + parse logs — there is no Prometheus exporter):**
- `/stats` — outbox counts by status.
- `/status` — DB size vs disk free, journal mode, counts. **Scrape db-size-vs-disk-free.**
- `/status/integrity-check` — on-demand store integrity.
- `/ws/stats` — ~1 Hz queue-depth WebSocket.
- `/messages` + `/messages/{id}` — per-message detail and the **event trail** (read this, not just the
  status — see §7).
- `/dead-letters` — **page on dead-letter accumulation.**
- **AlertSink events** to alert on: `connection_stopped`, `queue_buildup`, `storage_threshold` (wire
  these to webhook/email — §7).
- **`service.err.log`** — watch it.

> Note: the browser web console (`/ui`) surfaces dispositions, dead-letters, and alerts; the **CLI/API**
> remain available for scripted dead-letter triage and alert management.

**Log management:** logs land under `<DataDir>\logs` via NSSM. Configure rotation, keep the level at
`INFO` or above (DEBUG can leak PHI — §6), treat `service.out/err.log` as **potential-PHI artifacts**
(ACL them; don't ship them off-box — off-box logging is deferred), and include them in your retention
policy.

**Graceful drain for maintenance:** stopping the service (Ctrl+C / NSSM stop) triggers the ASGI
lifespan to call `engine.stop()` for a clean drain. Always **drain → stop → back up → change → restart
→ verify**.

**Failure-drill runbook — rehearse these in the lab/staging before prod:**

| Symptom | First moves |
|---|---|
| **Stuck FIFO lane** (retry-forever head) | `queue_buildup` alert → inspect `/messages` for the head → fix-and-`replay`, or `dead_letter_now` to unblock the lane (the dead row stays replayable). |
| **Poison message** | It dead-letters under `CONTINUE` (or stops the lane under `STOP`) → triage via `/dead-letters` → fix the transform → replay. |
| **Full disk / `storage_threshold`** | Free space / tighten `[retention]` / VACUUM → confirm `/status` disk-free recovers. |
| **Crash / unexpected restart** | Startup auto-recovers in-flight rows → verify `/health`, the "wiring started" banner, and that backlog drains. |
| **Planned maintenance** | Drain-and-stop (graceful), perform the change, restart, verify. |

---

## 13. Upgrade & rollback

**Safe upgrade runbook (pinned-wheel model):**
1. **Drain** inbound (quiesce senders or stop accepting new work) and confirm queues are draining.
2. **Stop** the service (graceful).
3. **Back up** the store **and** the encryption key (§10).
4. **Bump the pinned engine version:** update the pin in your config repo's `requirements.txt`
   (`messagefoundry==<new>`) and `pip install "messagefoundry==<new>"` into the deployment venv. *(A
   contributor on the **editable** install instead pulls the target commit/tag and `pip install -e .` —
   treat that checkout as the release artifact; §4.4.)*
5. **Re-validate:** run `messagefoundry check` against your config (and `ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest` too if
   you develop the engine).
6. **Restart** and **verify** (`/health`, "wiring started" banner, `/status`).

**Rollback:**
- **Config rollback** is the cheapest lever: the audited `POST /config/reload` does a quiesce-and-swap
  to a known-good `--config` directory (confined to the allow-listed reload roots). Keep your last
  known-good config dir available.
- **Engine rollback:** re-pin the prior version (`pip install "messagefoundry==<prev>"`) → restart
  (same runbook above). *(Contributors on the editable install: `git checkout` the prior commit/tag →
  reinstall → restart.)*
- ⚠️ **Schema/store-level changes are not trivially reversible** against a populated store given the
  greenfield-only posture (no in-place migration). Plan code/config rollback as your primary path;
  use **dead-letter replay** to recover messages that a bad transform stranded before the rollback.

**Pre-1.0 cadence:** pin a released version (`messagefoundry==X.Y.Z`); the **latest release** is the
supported target. Reproduce a problem against the latest release before filing an issue, and keep
upgrades **small and frequent** rather than large and rare.

---

## 14. High availability — rollout & VIP standup runbook

**Single-node is the default and is genuinely reliable** — the durable staged queue (§7), not
clustering, is what guarantees no message is lost on one node. Reach for HA only when you need
**failover** (an unattended node loss must not stop intake), **not** for throughput (for that, scale
intra-node — see the end of this section). When you do need it, MessageFoundry ships an **opt-in
active-passive cluster** (Track B) — the supported HA model. This section is the operational runbook;
the authoritative topology, lease semantics, and full settings catalog are in
**[CLUSTERING.md](CLUSTERING.md)**.

**The model in one paragraph.** Run N identical engine processes against **one shared server database**
(PostgreSQL or SQL Server) with `[cluster].enabled = true`. Exactly one node — the **leader/primary** —
runs the whole message graph (every listener *and* the router/transform/delivery workers); the rest are
**warm standbys** that only contend for leadership (heartbeat + cache convergence), binding no listeners
and running no workers until they win it. A **self-fencing leadership lease** in the shared DB elects the
one primary and guarantees a partitioned old primary stops before a standby takes over. There is no
separate broker and no node-to-node socket — coordination rides the shared `[store]` connection.

### 14.1 Stand up the cluster

1. **Pick a server-DB backend and make the DB tier itself HA.** `[store].backend = "postgres"` or
   `"sqlserver"` (SQLite is rejected for clustering). MEFOR coordinates the *processing* leader; it does
   **not** replicate your store — delegate store HA to the database (**PostgreSQL streaming replication /
   managed-Postgres HA**, or **SQL Server Always On**) and rehearse a DB failover separately.
2. **Provision every node identically.** Same installed engine version, the **same config dir**, and the
   **same `[store]` target** (server/database/schema) on each host. Set `[store].pool_size ≥ 2`
   (**≥ 3 recommended** — the leader drives the maintenance loop + reclaim sweep + workers concurrently).
3. **Enable the cluster** in the shared `messagefoundry.toml`:
   ```toml
   [cluster]
   enabled = true
   heartbeat_seconds            = 10.0   # keep the invariant: heartbeat < fence < ttl
   leader_fence_timeout_seconds = 20.0   # a leader that can't renew self-fences here (split-brain guard)
   leader_lease_ttl_seconds     = 30.0   # a standby may acquire only once the lease has expired
   ```
   The defaults trade a ~30 s crash-failover for margin; lower all three **proportionally** for faster
   failover at the cost of tolerance for a slow DB / GC pause.
4. **Sync clocks (NTP).** Row leases use node wall-clock — keep nodes synced so a lease expiry isn't
   mistimed. (Leadership is evaluated on the *DB* clock, so it's skew-immune; the row leases are not.)
5. **Start the same `serve` command on every node** (run each as its own NSSM service — see
   [SERVICE.md](SERVICE.md)). Confirm membership: `GET /cluster/nodes` lists every node and names exactly
   one `leader_node_id`; each node's `GET /cluster/status` reports `role: "primary"` on one and
   `"standby"` on the rest.

### 14.2 Stand up the VIP / load balancer (required)

Like Rhapsody/Corepoint, senders must reach "the engine" through a **floating VIP / L4 load balancer**,
never a fixed node — because **only the primary binds the inbound listener ports**, the VIP is what makes
a failover transparent (modulo a reconnect). **MEFOR ships the bind behavior and the `/cluster/*`
endpoints, but does not ship a load balancer** — you stand one up (keepalived + IPVS, HAProxy in `tcp`
mode, an F5, a cloud **L4 / network** LB, …).

**Data plane (MLLP / raw-TCP / X12 inbound) — one VIP per listener port:**

- [ ] **Mode = L4 / TCP pass-through.** These are byte streams — do **not** front them with an HTTP/L7 LB.
- [ ] **Health check = a plain TCP connect to that exact listener port** on each backend node. Because
      only the primary binds the port, exactly one backend is ever healthy, so the VIP routes there
      automatically; on failover the old primary's port closes (goes unhealthy) and the new primary's
      opens (goes healthy) and the VIP follows. An application-level (MLLP-message) probe is unnecessary —
      a TCP connect is the correct, sufficient signal.
- [ ] **Tune the probe to your failover budget.** The VIP repoints in roughly
      `check_interval × unhealthy_threshold`; size it well under your acceptable outage and above your
      DB/GC jitter (a 2–5 s interval is typical).
- [ ] **If MLLP-over-TLS is on, keep TLS end-to-end** (TCP pass-through) so the engine's own cert is
      presented; don't terminate TLS at the VIP unless you re-encrypt to the backends.
- [ ] **Don't let the LB reap long-lived MLLP sockets** — set TCP idle timeouts generous enough for
      persistent connections.
- [ ] **Verify every partner reconnects-on-drop.** On failover, connections to the old primary drop and
      senders must redial the VIP. This is standard MLLP client behavior — confirm it per partner.

**Management plane (console / IDE → engine API) — optional VIP:**

- [ ] The API is a control/read plane over the shared DB and is **up on every node**, so an API VIP can
      health-check the unauthenticated **`GET /health`** (liveness); you can point the console at any node.
- [ ] To pin operators to the active leader, read **`GET /cluster/status`** → `role`
      (`primary`/`standby`) or **`GET /cluster/nodes`** → `leader_node_id` / `lease_owner` (the console
      already surfaces the live primary). Both endpoints need only `MONITORING_READ` (VIEWER and up; no PHI).

### 14.3 Rehearse & validate failover (before real traffic)

Failover is **not instantaneous** — quantify *your* window from these drills; don't assume zero-downtime.

- [ ] **Clean switchover** (planned): gracefully stop the primary's service. It **expires its lease**, so
      a standby promotes on its next heartbeat (**≈ one `heartbeat_seconds`**). Watch `leader_node_id`
      move on `/cluster/nodes`, watch the VIP repoint, and keep synthetic traffic flowing throughout.
- [ ] **Crash** (unplanned): hard-kill / power off the primary. Its lease **ages out**, so a standby
      promotes after **up to `leader_lease_ttl_seconds`** (~30 s default); a partitioned old primary
      **self-fences within `leader_fence_timeout_seconds`** so it can't double-process. Confirm the new
      primary's **owner-scoped on-promotion recovery** re-pends the dead primary's in-flight rows
      immediately (delivery resumes without waiting out the per-row lease TTL).
- [ ] **Zero-loss across the failover.** At-least-once means a row interrupted mid-delivery is
      **re-delivered** after its lease expires — so confirm your downstream connectors **dedupe / are
      idempotent**, then reconcile sent-vs-delivered across the drill.
- [ ] **Record the measured window** and, if needed, tune `heartbeat < fence < ttl` down proportionally
      and re-drill.

### 14.4 HA go-live checklist

- [ ] Server-DB backend; **DB-tier HA configured and its own failover rehearsed**.
- [ ] Identical engine version + config dir + `[store]` target on every node; `pool_size ≥ 3`; **clocks
      NTP-synced**.
- [ ] `/cluster/nodes` shows all nodes and exactly one `leader_node_id`.
- [ ] **VIP per inbound port** with a **TCP-connect health check**; partner **reconnect-on-drop** verified.
- [ ] **Clean-switchover drill** passed (≈ one heartbeat, VIP follows, zero loss).
- [ ] **Crash drill** passed (failover within the TTL, no double-processing, in-flight rows recovered,
      zero loss).
- [ ] Measured failover window documented; lease timings tuned to your network.
- [ ] **Config changes applied as a coordinated (non-rolling) restart** — all nodes restart together so
      they never run divergent graphs across the change window.
- [ ] `/cluster/status` + `/cluster/nodes` monitored (alert on **no live leader** beyond a failover
      window) alongside the §12 surfaces.

**For throughput (not failover), scale intra-node:** one independent delivery worker per outbound
connection (a slow/failing lane never blocks siblings), and keep retry policies finite where head-of-line
blocking on a shared FIFO lane would otherwise stall throughput. Adding cluster nodes does **not** raise
throughput — only the leader processes.

## 15. Getting help & reporting bugs

- **Bugs & feature requests:** open a GitHub issue using the repository's issue templates
  (`bug_report.md` / `feature_request.md`).
- **Security vulnerabilities:** use the repository's **private security advisory** process per
  `.github/SECURITY.md` — do **not** open a public issue for a vulnerability.
- **Before filing:** verify against current `main` (pre-1.0, latest-main-only support), and include the
  engine version, config shape, and relevant **non-PHI** log excerpts.
- 🔒 **Never attach real PHI** to an issue, log excerpt, or reproduction. Reproduce with a synthetic
  corpus from `messagefoundry generate`.

---

## 16. Decommissioning a pilot

Ending a pilot is a **PHI-disposal** event. `uninstall-service.ps1` removes the service but
**deliberately leaves the store and logs on disk**. To tear down cleanly:

1. **Graceful drain + stop**, confirm no in-flight work remains.
2. **Uninstall the service** (`scripts\service\uninstall-service.ps1`).
3. **Securely dispose of all PHI-bearing artifacts:** the store (`.db` + `-wal` + `-shm`), any
   PostgreSQL database/backups, **File-connector spill directories**, the `logs` directory, every
   **backup copy**, and the **encryption key / DPAPI key file**.
4. **Revoke credentials** (service account, AD bind account, any API tokens).

Treat backups and the encryption key with the same disposal rigor as the live store — a forgotten
encrypted backup plus its escrowed key is still recoverable PHI.
