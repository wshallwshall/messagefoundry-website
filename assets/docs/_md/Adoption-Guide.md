# Adoption & Rollout Guide

This guide is for teams adopting **MessageFoundry** — an open-source, Python healthcare interface
engine — and taking it from a first install to full production use. It is an **orchestration**
document: it ties the reference docs together and adds the install-to-production **rollout plan** that
nothing else covers. Where a topic has a dedicated reference, this guide links to it rather than
repeating it.

> **Read this section first.** MessageFoundry does a focused set of things well, and a staged rollout
> is the safest way to put any new interface engine into production. The point of the staged rollout
> in section 11 is to find issues where they are cheap (a lab, a shadow feed) instead of where they are
> expensive (a production cut-over). If you adopt MessageFoundry, adopt the rollout discipline with it.

## 1. What MessageFoundry is, and who should adopt it

MessageFoundry routes, transforms, and validates messages between **Connections** — HL7 v2.x by
default, with payload-agnostic support for a wide range of other formats including X12 and FHIR — and
its routing and handling are written in **Python**. The runtime model is a graph wired by name:

- **Connection** — an endpoint that receives (inbound) or sends (outbound) messages: MLLP, TCP, File,
  REST/SOAP, X12, FHIR, and Database destinations, plus a Database poll source. See
  [CONNECTIONS.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CONNECTIONS.md).
- **Router** — a Python function bound to an inbound connection that decides which Handler(s) see each
  message.
- **Handler** — a Python function that filters, transforms a message, and emits `Send`s to outbound
  connections.

The engine is a **headless asyncio service** (FastAPI/uvicorn) that owns a durable message store and
supervises one worker set per connection. A separate **desktop console** and a **VS Code extension**
operate it over an HTTP API. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
full model.

**Who should adopt it.** Teams who want a Python-native, open-source healthcare interface engine and
who prefer to validate any new tool against their own traffic before trusting it. A single engine node
on a trusted network is the simplest deployment; **native TLS** (API + MLLP) and an opt-in
**active-passive failover** cluster on a shared server database (PostgreSQL or SQL Server) are both
available when you need them (see sections 2, 6, and 14). Horizontal *active-active* scale-out is not
the model — active-passive HA is the supported HA pattern, and throughput scales intra-node (section
14).

---

## 2. Capabilities at a glance

MessageFoundry is built for single-node production and also supports **opt-in active-passive failover**
(a leader/standby cluster on a shared server database — PostgreSQL or SQL Server; section 14). The
authoritative reference is
[ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); use the
table below alongside it when planning.

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Code-first Connection/Router/Handler graph | The core runtime model. |
| **SQLite (WAL)** store backend | Zero-config default; single-node and development. |
| **PostgreSQL** store backend | Full staged pipeline, at-rest encryption, retention; production-grade. |
| **Microsoft SQL Server** store backend | Full staged pipeline + response capture, at-rest encryption; needs the `sqlserver` extra + OS-level ODBC Driver 18. Retention is managed at the DBA tier (TDE + SQL Agent). |
| Transactional staged queue (ingress→routed→outbound), at-least-once, dead-letter, replay | See [ADR 0001](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-staged-pipeline-architecture.md). |
| Auth + RBAC + hash-chained audit log | See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md). |
| Multi-factor authentication | **Required** for local accounts; enterprise/AD users get MFA through their own identity provider via SSO federation. |
| At-rest body encryption (AES-256-GCM, opt-in) + key rotation | See [PHI.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/PHI.md). |
| Connectors: MLLP / TCP / File; REST / SOAP; **X12**; **FHIR**; Database destinations; Database poll source | See [CONNECTIONS.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CONNECTIONS.md). |
| Interface authentication: **mTLS**, **OAuth 2.0 client-credentials**, **SMART-on-FHIR Backend Services** | For securing inbound/outbound interfaces. |
| Native transport TLS (API + MLLP) | In-process API TLS (HTTPS/WSS) + per-connection MLLP-over-TLS, TLS 1.2 or higher, opt-in mTLS, and a fail-closed off-loopback bind guard. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md). |
| Validation & load tooling (`generate`, `check`, `dryrun`, the test harness, the load harness) | See sections 8/9 and [LOAD-TESTING.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/LOAD-TESTING.md). |
| Operational metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) | Exposes engine metrics for scraping (section 12). |
| Console **Alerts** and **Dead-Letters** pages | Triage dead-letters and manage alerts from the desktop console (section 12). |
| Windows-service deployment | See [SERVICE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SERVICE.md). |
| Active-passive HA / failover | Opt-in leader/standby cluster on a shared server database (PostgreSQL or SQL Server): only the leader runs the graph, with a self-fencing leadership lease and immediate on-promotion recovery. Single-node stays the default. See [CLUSTERING.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CLUSTERING.md) and section 14. |

### Deployment guidance and honest caveats

- **Raw TCP and X12 transports are plaintext on the wire.** Keep them on a trusted network segment or
  front them with a TLS-terminating proxy. (API and MLLP do have native TLS — see section 6 and
  [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).)
- **ACK semantics are ACK-on-receipt.** The sender is acknowledged once the message is durably
  committed; any later routing/transform/delivery failure surfaces as a message disposition + alert,
  not a NAK. Operators monitor disposition and alerts for post-ingress failures, not the ACK (section
  7).
- **Server-database deployments are greenfield.** There is no automatic in-place migration of SQLite
  history into a server database — drain and cut over deliberately (section 13).
- **Throughput is hardware-dependent.** A baseline and tuning method is published
  ([TUNING-BASELINE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md))
  as a two-tier reference: host-independent conformance invariants plus performance numbers measured on
  the reference configuration. Those throughput figures are measurements on that reference config, not
  a promise for your hardware — **measure on your own hardware** (section 9).

## 3. Prerequisites & environment checklist

Consolidate these before you install anything:

- [ ] **Python 3.14+** on the engine host.
- [ ] **OS:** Windows is the primary supported/serviced platform; the engine itself is cross-platform
      Python.
- [ ] **Administrator/elevation** on the host if you will install the Windows service.
- [ ] **Outbound network access** for the service installer to download its SHA-256-pinned dependency
      (or pre-stage it on the host / on `PATH`).
- [ ] **Firewall plan:** open your inbound MLLP listener port(s) (the samples use e.g. `2575`/`2600`)
      to senders, and decide who may reach the **API on `127.0.0.1:8765`** (default loopback — keep it
      that way unless you configure TLS; see section 6).
- [ ] **A writable data directory** for the store + logs (service default:
      `C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry`).
- [ ] **Backend decision (made here, not later):** **SQLite** (default, zero extra deps) for a
      single-node deployment, or a server database — **PostgreSQL** (`messagefoundry[postgres]`,
      pure-Python) or **SQL Server** (`messagefoundry[sqlserver]` + OS-level ODBC Driver 18) — if you
      want a server store or a path toward DB-tier HA.
- [ ] If you will run the **cluster** path (active-passive failover): **NTP time sync** across nodes is
      a hard prerequisite, every node needs the **same config dir**, and `[store].backend = "postgres"`
      or `"sqlserver"`. (Single-node deployments skip this entirely; see section 14.)
- [ ] A **PHI encryption key** plan (section 6) and a **backup target + key-escrow** plan (section 10)
      decided before any real data flows.

## 4. Installation

> **New here? Start with the
> [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/INSTALL-GUIDE.md)** —
> the focused walkthrough of installing the engine and standing up your own private **config repo**,
> including running multiple instances from one repo. This section is the rollout-oriented summary of
> the same material.

Full reference: the
[Installation Guide](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/INSTALL-GUIDE.md) and
[SERVICE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SERVICE.md). The essentials:

### 4.1 Install the engine

MessageFoundry is a **version-pinned dependency**: install a published wheel and **pin the exact
version**, the same way you pin any other production dependency. Create a venv and install:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install "messagefoundry==0.2.2"        # pin the exact engine version (core runtime only)
```

The pinned install pulls only the **core runtime** — what a headless engine needs. Add extras (section
4.2) for the desktop console, a server-database backend, or SFTP. `pip install messagefoundry` from
public PyPI is the standard install path; you can equally install from the engine's **GitHub Release
assets**.

**Verify the release before you install.** MessageFoundry ships one signed wheel to many PHI-bearing
instances, so verify the artifact's provenance *before* installing — pinning a version (or a hash)
proves you got a *fixed* file, not that it is the one MessageFoundry built. Every release carries
**SLSA build provenance** and a **Sigstore signature** via token-less Trusted Publishing; check both
with the **GitHub CLI** (`gh` ≥ 2.49), and optionally `sigstore` (`pip install sigstore`). Install
**only** the file that passes:

```powershell
$V = "0.2.2"   # the exact version you intend to install

# Download the wheel + its Sigstore bundle from that release's assets
gh release download "v$V" --repo MEFORORG/MessageFoundry `
  --pattern "messagefoundry-$V-*.whl" --pattern "messagefoundry-$V-*.whl.sigstore*"

# Verify SLSA build provenance:  artifact -> source commit -> builder workflow
gh attestation verify "messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl" --repo MEFORORG/MessageFoundry

# (defense in depth) Verify the Sigstore signature pins the release workflow identity
python -m sigstore verify identity "messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl" `
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v$V" `
  --cert-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"

# Only if BOTH pass, install the exact file you verified
pip install ".\messagefoundry-$V-py3-none-any.whl"
```

The same attestation also covers the **public PyPI** copy (it is byte-identical), so you can
`pip download "messagefoundry==$V" --no-deps -d .\verify`, `gh attestation verify` the downloaded
wheel, then `pip install --no-index --find-links .\verify "messagefoundry==$V"`. A registry/mirror
substitution or a relabelled file **fails** the check. (The `--cert-identity` ref must match the tag
you install.)

For a **reproducible pinned** deploy, generate a hash-locked requirements file scoped to the extras you
actually run and install it with `--require-hashes`. The scaffolded config repo (`messagefoundry init`,
below) already pins the engine in its `requirements.txt` — extend that into a full hash-lock for your
host.

### 4.2 Optional extras

| Extra | Pulls in | When |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `asyncpg` (pure-Python, no OS dep) | Using the PostgreSQL backend (recommended production path). |
| `console` | desktop UI + keyring | Running the desktop admin console. |
| `sftp` | paramiko | SFTP connectors. |
| `sqlserver` | `aioodbc` **+ OS-level Microsoft ODBC Driver 18** | The SQL Server *store* backend (`backend=sqlserver`, production) and the Database connector family. |
| `dev` | pytest/ruff/mypy/httpx | Development & CI. |

> ⚠️ If you set `backend=postgres` but forget `pip install 'messagefoundry[postgres]'`, you get a raw
> `ImportError` at startup. Install the extra together with the backend.

### Start your own config repo (`messagefoundry init`)

Section 4.1 installed the **engine**. Now scaffold the other half a deploying organization owns — your
**own** separately-versioned **config repo** — which holds your Connections/Routers/Handlers and drives
one or more engine instances. **This is the recommended way to run MessageFoundry:** the `samples/`
directory used in quickstarts ships only in a source checkout, **not in the installed wheel**, so a
wheel install runs against *your* `config/`, not `samples/`.

```powershell
messagefoundry init ./my-config-repo
```

It writes a runnable starter feed (`config/`), `environments/<env>.toml` value stubs, a synthetic
fixture, an instance `messagefoundry.toml` (active environment + posture), a `requirements.txt` pinning
this engine version, a CI `check` workflow, and `.vscode` settings — so
`messagefoundry check --config config --messages messages/sets` is green from the first commit. See the
generated `README.md` for the day-to-day workflow.

### 4.3 Run it (foreground, to learn the ropes)

From your config repo (the one `messagefoundry init` created), run the engine against its `config/`
directory:

```powershell
cd ./my-config-repo
python -m messagefoundry serve --config config --db ./messagefoundry.db --env dev
```

`serve` flags and their precedence (**CLI > `MEFOR_<SECTION>_<KEY>` env > `messagefoundry.toml` >
built-in default**): `--config` (your graph directory), `--service-config` (default
`./messagefoundry.toml` if present), `--db`, `--host`, `--port`, `--log-level`, `--env` (a **free-form**
environment name), `--allow-insecure-bind`.

> ⚠️ **The active environment is required.** `serve` refuses to start (exit 2) without `--env <name>`
> (or `[ai].environment`) — there is no silent `prod` default, so a missing env can never resolve
> another environment's values/secrets. Built-in names `dev`/`staging`/`prod` carry a default posture;
> a custom name (e.g. `test`, `poc`) also needs `[ai].data_class` + `[ai].production`. The active
> environment is logged at startup.

### 4.4 Run it as a Windows service (the supported production run-mode)

Use the elevated installer; install under a **least-privilege virtual account** rather than the default
LocalSystem:

```powershell
# from an elevated shell
scripts\service\install-service.ps1 -ServiceAccount "NT SERVICE\MessageFoundry"
```

The installer is idempotent, auto-downloads a SHA-256-pinned service shim, bakes absolute `serve` paths
into the service, and (with `-ServiceAccount`) auto-grants config-read + data-dir-read/write to the
account. Service defaults: name `MessageFoundry`, data dir `C:\ProgramData\MessageFoundry`, store
`<DataDir>\messagefoundry.db`, logs `<DataDir>\logs`, bind `127.0.0.1:8765`.

> ⚠️ **Pinned-wheel operational model.** With a pinned-version install (section 4.1), the running
> service loads the **installed wheel** — a known, pinned version. Picking up a new engine version is a
> deliberate `pip install "messagefoundry==<new>"` + service restart (section 13), so every upgrade is
> an explicit, reviewable act.

### 4.5 First-run admin bootstrap

Auth is **enabled by default**. On the first start against an empty store, MessageFoundry creates a
one-time bootstrap admin (`admin`) and writes its password to an **owner-only `bootstrap-admin.txt`**
next to the store (only the file *location* is logged — never the password). Then:

1. Log in as `admin`; you are **forced to change the password** on first use, and to enrol the required
   MFA factor.
2. **Create a second real administrator** promptly.
3. **Delete `bootstrap-admin.txt`.**

The bootstrap account auto-retires once a second admin exists, or — while still unclaimed — 72h after
creation.

### 4.6 Verify it runs

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health           # -> {"status":"ok"}
# tail <DataDir>\logs\service.out.log for the "wiring started" banner
```

Then send a synthetic message to confirm the end-to-end path. The scaffolded starter feed listens on
MLLP `2575` and ships a PHI-free fixture at `messages/sets/example_adt.hl7` — send it with any MLLP
client. The convenience senders ship with the **engine source checkout**, not the installed wheel.

If start fails, check `service.err.log` first — the common causes are relative paths resolving to the
system dir under a service account, a busy MLLP/API port, or a data dir the account can't write.

## 5. Minimum viable configuration

Full reference:
[CONFIGURATION.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) (service
settings) and
[CONNECTIONS.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CONNECTIONS.md) (the graph).

There are two distinct configuration surfaces:

1. **The message graph (Python modules)** in your `--config` directory. The minimum first flow is one
   module: an `inbound()` with a transport spec and a `router=` binding, a `@router` that returns
   handler name(s), and a `@handler` that returns `Send(...)` to a declared `outbound()`. The
   scaffolded repo (`messagefoundry init`, section 4) gives you a working `config/IB_EXAMPLE_ADT.py` to
   start from. The loader globs `*.py` (non-recursive; skips `_*`-prefixed helper files), then merges
   an optional `connections.toml`.
2. **Service/operational settings** in `messagefoundry.toml` (+ `MEFOR_*` env + CLI). Keep **all
   secrets out of this file and out of source control** — supply them via `MEFOR_<SECTION>_<KEY>` env
   vars (the loader *warns* if it sees a known secret in the file).

Guidance for a clean first flow:

- **Use the MLLP/File pair** for an initial end-to-end test — both need no extras. The Database
  connector family adds the `sqlserver` extra + ODBC Driver 18; MLLP/File keep the first hop
  dependency-free.
- **Never set a host on an inbound MLLP/TCP connection** (it is a config error). Set the listen
  interface once, service-side, via `[inbound].bind_host` (loopback for dev; a specific NIC behind a
  firewall for prod). Outbound MLLP/TCP *do* take the downstream host.
- **Author anything environment-specific as `env("key")`**, put non-secret values in
  `environments/dev.toml` / `environments/prod.toml` with identical keys, and inject secrets only via
  `MEFOR_VALUE_<KEY>`. A referenced-but-undefined key fails loud at load. Use `current_environment()`
  (not `env()`) inside a handler to branch on the deployment.
- **`connections.toml` (data) is optional:** move *transport config* there if you want hand/GUI
  editing; keep *logic* (routers/handlers) in `.py`. A name declared in both a module and
  `connections.toml` is a hard error (no silent shadowing).
- **The `--config` directory is a trust boundary.** `serve` and `POST /config/reload` **execute** the
  Python in it, in-process, as the service account. On POSIX the loader refuses a group/world-writable
  config dir; **on Windows this is your responsibility** — lock the directory's ACL to admins + the
  service account.

## 6. Security & PHI hardening before real data

Full references:
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md),
[PHI.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/PHI.md), and
[DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) (network
exposure). MessageFoundry ships real auth with required MFA for local accounts, RBAC, audit, opt-in
at-rest encryption, **native TLS** (API + MLLP, with a fail-closed off-loopback bind guard), and
interface authentication via mTLS, OAuth 2.0 client-credentials, and SMART-on-FHIR Backend Services.
The features here support a **HIPAA-compliant deployment**; compliance is a property of how you operate
the system, so complete this checklist **before any real PHI flows**:

- [ ] **API off-loopback requires native TLS.** The API binds `127.0.0.1` by default. To reach it from
      another host, configure **in-process TLS** (`[api].tls_cert_file` + `[api].tls_key_file`,
      `tls_min_version` ≥ 1.2, opt-in mTLS via `tls_client_ca_file`) **or** front it with a TLS
      terminator (`[api].tls_terminated_upstream = true` + `[api].trusted_proxies`). A non-loopback
      bind **without** TLS (or a trusted terminator) is **refused at startup**. **Never use
      `--allow-insecure-bind` for real PHI** — it is a loud dev-only escape that puts bearer tokens and
      PHI on the wire in cleartext.
- [ ] **MLLP off-loopback requires native TLS too.** MLLP-over-TLS is built: set `tls = true` +
      `tls_cert_file`/`tls_key_file` per connection (opt-in mTLS via `tls_ca_file`; ≥ TLS 1.2). MLLP is
      **plaintext by default**, and a non-loopback plaintext MLLP bind is refused. **Raw TCP and X12
      have no transport TLS** — keep them on a trusted segment or proxy-terminate. Full matrix:
      [DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
- [ ] **Turn on at-rest encryption and make it mandatory:** mint a key with `messagefoundry gen-key`
      (or a Windows DPAPI-protected key file via `messagefoundry protect-key`), set
      `MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, **and** set `[store].require_encryption = true` so the engine
      refuses to start unencrypted.
- [ ] **Enable volume encryption (BitLocker/LUKS).** App-level encryption protects message *bodies*;
      the `summary` / `control_id` / `message_type` columns and the `-wal`/`-shm`/temp files are **not**
      app-encrypted and rely on volume encryption.
- [ ] **Run under a least-privilege account** (the virtual account from section 4.4) and lock down the
      store directory and any File-connector spill directories. **Treat backups as PHI.**
- [ ] **Finish the bootstrap-admin handoff** (section 4.5): change the password, enrol MFA, create a
      second admin, delete `bootstrap-admin.txt`.
- [ ] **For Active Directory:** use **LDAPS** with a trusted CA, never set `MEFOR_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS`
      in production, and configure the directory's lockout/complexity policy. AD users authenticate (and
      get MFA) through your own identity provider via SSO federation; the engine's built-in MFA and
      account lockout cover local accounts.
- [ ] **Populate the fail-closed `[egress]` allowlist** (it defaults to unrestricted) for
      REST/Database destinations.
- [ ] **Keep logging at `INFO` or above** and `expose_docs` off in production. Full payloads are never
      logged at INFO+ by design — **do not raise the service to DEBUG with real PHI**.
- [ ] **Author routers/handlers so they never interpolate raw HL7 into an exception message** (it can
      surface in `last_error`/`detail`).
- [ ] Run **`messagefoundry audit-verify`** periodically (the audit log is tamper-*evident*, not
      tamper-*proof*), and set `[retention]` windows — they are **off by default (kept forever)**.

> **Security posture.** MessageFoundry has completed an internal **OWASP ASVS 5.0 Level 3
> self-assessment** (212 requirements met, 0 failed, 0 partial, 133 not applicable, of 345). This is a
> self-assessment, **not** an external audit. ASVS Level 3 recommends — but does not require — an
> independent code review and penetration test; both are planned. See
> [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md).

## 7. Reliability configuration — how nothing gets lost

This is the heart of operating the engine safely. The durability model is a **transactional staged
queue** (no external broker): each message flows ingress → routed → outbound, with every handoff a
single committed transaction, giving **at-least-once** delivery with crash-safe re-runs. Details in
[ADR 0001](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-staged-pipeline-architecture.md).

Key semantics to internalize:

- **ACK-on-receipt.** The sender is acknowledged (`AA`) as soon as the raw message is durably committed
  (after synchronous decode/parse/optional strict-validate, which still NAK). **Any
  routing/transform/delivery failure happens *after* the ACK** and surfaces as an internal
  **disposition + alert**, never a NAK. Operators monitor disposition + alerts, **not** the ACK, for
  post-ingress failures.
- **Disposition lifecycle:** `RECEIVED` → `ROUTED`/`UNROUTED` → `PROCESSED`/`FILTERED`/`ERROR`. The
  store finalizer is the **sole authority** and never finalizes while any stage row is still in flight.
  Note: a single dead row at *any* stage flips the whole message to `ERROR` **even if a sibling handler
  delivered** — so read the **per-message event trail**, not just the headline status.
- **Failure classification & policy (per outbound):**
  - Permanent partner reject (`AR`/`CR`) → **dead-letter immediately** (still replayable).
  - Transient (`AE`/`CE`) or transport error → **retry per `RetryPolicy`**.
  - Internal/code error → either **STOP** the lane and raise a `connection_stopped` alert, or
    **CONTINUE** (auto-dead-letter the bad message and keep flowing).
  - **`RetryPolicy.max_attempts` unset = retry forever** (nothing silently lost) with exponential
    backoff. Under the default **FIFO** ordering, a permanently-failing head **blocks its lane** until
    it succeeds or is purged.

**Mandatory before go-live:**

- [ ] **Wire real alerts.** Configure the `[alerts]` **webhook and/or email** notifier — do **not**
      rely on the default logging-only sink. The conservative defaults (FIFO head-of-line blocking,
      retry-forever, STOP-on-internal-error) are only safe if a human gets paged when a lane stalls.
- [ ] **Set `[delivery]` buildup thresholds** (`max_oldest_seconds` defaults to 300s; set a `max_depth`
      sized to each connection's throughput) so `queue_buildup` fires before a stuck lane silently backs
      up. Buildup detection covers the ingress and routed stages too, not just outbound.
- [ ] **Choose `RetryPolicy` per outbound deliberately:** retry-forever for partners that must never
      lose a message (accept head-of-line blocking + rely on buildup alerts), or a finite `max_attempts`
      where stale data is worse than a replayable dead-letter.
- [ ] **Choose `InternalErrorPolicy` intentionally:** `CONTINUE` (default) for high-volume feeds where
      uptime matters most; `STOP` for low-volume feeds where ordering/no-loss matters more than uptime.
- [ ] **Code routers/handlers as pure and idempotent.** At-least-once means a message can re-run after a
      crash or a replay. No side-effecting writes mid-transform; the **one** allowed exception is a
      **live, read-only DB lookup**. Downstream connectors/partners must **dedupe** (e.g. on MSH control
      id).

Recovery tools you should know cold: **`/dead-letters`** (triage) + **`/dead-letters/replay`** (bulk
*outbound* recovery), and per-message **`/messages/{id}/replay`** (for dead ingress/routed rows —
router/transform errors, undecryptable raw, a removed handler). Startup automatically returns stale
in-flight rows to pending (crash recovery) and dead-letters rows whose destination/handler left the
config. The console **Dead-Letters** page surfaces this triage in the UI (section 12).

## 8. Pre-traffic validation

Prove correctness **before** any network traffic. None of this should ever run against real PHI —
`generate`/`dryrun` can emit full message bodies; never redirect their output to a committed file or CI
log.

1. **Build a synthetic corpus:** `messagefoundry generate --type ADT --count 50 --out <fixtures>`
   (conformant HL7 v2.5.1, validated against hl7apy; 13 message types, 57 ADT triggers; PHI-free).
2. **Gate the config in CI / a pre-commit hook:**
   `messagefoundry check --config <dir> --messages <fixtures>`.
   - `validate` (every module loads; every inbound→router reference resolves; no port collisions) is
     **required and blocking**.
   - `dryrun` is **required only when you supply a fixtures dir containing `*.hl7`** — **without
     fixtures the dryrun is silently skipped** and the gate passes on `validate` alone, so a transform
     that errors at runtime is *not* caught. **Build and maintain the fixtures.**
   - `ruff`/`mypy` are advisory (never block).
3. **Inspect the wiring:** `messagefoundry validate --json` (all problems at once) and
   `messagefoundry graph --config <dir>` (confirm the wired graph matches intent).
4. **Confirm dispositions:** `messagefoundry dryrun` runs the same core the live engine runs (no I/O),
   so dry-run and live route identically. Then exercise the **test harness**: its 5 headless
   `--scenario` runs (`processed`/`filtered`/`unrouted`/`error`/`dead_letter`) assert dispositions over
   the API for CI, and its GUI can inject delivery faults (delay-then-AA, close, fail-N-then-AA) to
   prove your **retry / dead-letter / replay** behavior before you trust it.

Note: `validate` only catches **literal** port collisions; `env()`-resolved ports are checked at bind
time. A `prod`-only missing `env()` value may not surface during a `dev`-context check — validate
against the target environment before promoting.

## 9. Capacity & load testing on *your* hardware

Full references:
[LOAD-TESTING.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/LOAD-TESTING.md) and the
published
[throughput baseline & tuning reference](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/TUNING-BASELINE.md)
— a **two-tier reference**: host-independent **conformance** invariants (zero loss, bounded drain, low
error rate) plus **performance** numbers *as measured on the reference config*. Because the
durable-write path is hardware-dependent, those throughput figures are **not** a promise for your
hardware — establish your own baseline.

The headless load harness drives an already-running engine over real MLLP and the HTTP API (it never
touches the store), so it is **store-agnostic** — swap the engine's `--db` to compare SQLite vs Postgres
ceilings on identical traffic.

Recommended ramp:

1. **`smoke`** — tiny zero-loss wiring check (no performance claim).
2. **`fanout-baseline`** — warmup → ramp → sustained → spike → recovery; SLOs are evaluated only on the
   measured sustained phases. Reference targets in the profile: ≥200 msg/s sustained, ACK p99 ≤50ms, e2e
   p99 ≤5s, error ≤0.001, drain ≤60s, zero-loss. (These are reference-config measurements, not a
   promise for your box.)
3. **`soak`** — ~1-hour steady state watching DB/WAL growth + dead-letter accumulation.

Treat the **zero-loss reconciliation** (`sent == engine_read`, `sink_received == engine_written`,
backlog drained to zero) as the **headline gate** — throughput numbers are meaningless if messages were
lost. Use a **closed-loop** phase (fixed concurrency) to find your true max sustainable throughput, and
the `slow` transform mode to find your per-core transform ceiling. Save the JSON/CSV reports and use
`--baseline` + `--tolerance` to catch regressions over time. Size `correlator_capacity` above your peak
in-flight (watch for correlation-miss notes), and remember a single Python sender process is the offer
ceiling — shard it across processes if it can't saturate your engine.

**Sizing reality:** the staged pipeline has ~**3× write-amplification** on SQLite (3 commits for a
common single-handler message; 2 + H for an H-way fan-out) — see the
[write-amplification benchmark](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/step-b-write-amplification.md).
Plan disk headroom for `.db` + `-wal`, plan retention/VACUUM (section 10), and move to **Postgres** if a
single-writer SQLite ceiling becomes the bottleneck.

---

## 10. Backup, restore & disaster recovery

> Backup and DR are part of *your* operational responsibility. Rehearse a full restore before you carry
> real data.

**Back up the store.**

- **SQLite:** the WAL backend means three files must be captured **consistently** — `.db`, `.db-wal`,
  `.db-shm`. Use `sqlite3 <db> ".backup '<dest>'"` against the live DB, or take a **quiesced cold copy**
  (graceful stop → copy → restart). A naive copy of just the `.db` while the service runs can be
  inconsistent.
- **PostgreSQL:** use your standard DB backups — `pg_dump` for logical backups and/or WAL archiving /
  PITR for point-in-time recovery. Server-database deployments are greenfield, so the DB tier owns
  store-level DR here.

**Escrow the encryption key SEPARATELY.** If you enabled at-rest encryption (section 6), a restored
store is **unreadable without the same `MEFOR_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / DPAPI key file**. Back the key up
in a different location/system from the data, with its own access control.

**Restore-and-verify drill (do this in the lab, section 11 Stage 0):** restore the store + key into a
clean host, start the engine, confirm `/health`, run `/status/integrity-check` (SQLite
`PRAGMA quick_check`), and spot-check `/messages` and dispositions.

**Keep the store bounded.** `[retention]` is **off by default (kept forever)**. Set `max_db_mb` (drives
a `storage_threshold` alert), `messages_days` / `dead_letter_days` (body purge), and the daily VACUUM so
the store doesn't grow unbounded and a full disk doesn't take you down mid-operation.

---

## 11. Staged rollout plan with go/no-go gates

This is the recommended path from first install to full production. **Do not skip stages** — each one
exists to catch a different class of problem cheaply. Advance only when the stage's **exit criteria** are
met.

### Stage 0 — Lab / standalone

**Goal:** prove wiring, dispositions, and recovery on a throwaway box, with **synthetic data only**.

**Setup:** SQLite, loopback, auth on, a synthetic corpus from `messagefoundry generate`.

**Exit criteria (→ Stage 1):**
- [ ] `messagefoundry check --config <dir> --messages <fixtures>` exits 0 (validate **and** dryrun
      green).
- [ ] All 5 disposition `--scenario` runs pass (`processed`/`filtered`/`unrouted`/`error`/`dead_letter`).
- [ ] You have driven a retry → dead-letter → **replay** cycle via the harness fault injection and
      understand the recovery tools (section 7).
- [ ] A **backup + restore** has been rehearsed once (section 10).

### Stage 1 — Shadow / parallel run

**Goal:** run MessageFoundry alongside your **incumbent** engine on **real production traffic** without
affecting any downstream system.

**How:** tee/duplicate the production **inbound** feed to a MessageFoundry instance whose outbounds
point at a **throwaway/null sink** (the harness correlation sink works well), or use a router that
`Send`s only to a dedicated "shadow" outbound. Compare MessageFoundry's dispositions and transformed
output against the incumbent's outcomes for the same messages.

> ⚠️ **Do not dual-*write* to real partners in shadow.** At-least-once + non-idempotent downstreams make
> a true dual-write dangerous. Keep shadow outbounds pointed at a sink unless the partner dedupes.

**Exit criteria (→ Stage 2):**
- [ ] **Zero-loss reconciliation holds** over a sustained window (e.g. 1–2 weeks) at production volume.
- [ ] MessageFoundry dispositions/output **match the incumbent's** for the same messages (differences
      explained).
- [ ] **No unexplained dead-letters**; every `ERROR` understood.
- [ ] A load test on **production-like hardware** meets your own SLO targets (section 9).

### Stage 2 — Limited production

**Goal:** MessageFoundry becomes the system of record for a **small, low-risk subset** of real feeds
(one partner / one low-volume interface).

**Prereqs:** switch to **Postgres** if you need a server DB; **encryption on**
(`require_encryption=true`); **alerts wired** and **monitoring in place** (section 12); **backups
automated**; **upgrade + rollback runbook validated on staging** (section 13).

**Exit criteria (→ Stage 3):**
- [ ] e2e p99 within your SLO; **zero unexplained dead-letters** over the observation window.
- [ ] **Alert wiring proven by a deliberate fault-injection drill** — you triggered `queue_buildup` /
      `connection_stopped` and the on-call was actually paged.
- [ ] **Backup + restore rehearsed against the production store** (not just the lab copy).
- [ ] Rollback runbook exercised at least once.

### Stage 3 — Full production

**Goal:** migrate the remaining feeds **in waves** (never big-bang). Keep decommissioning the incumbent
as a **separate, later** step so you retain a fallback.

**Steady-state expectations:**
- [ ] Sustained-load SLO met on production hardware.
- [ ] DR (backup/restore) rehearsed and scheduled.
- [ ] On-call + the failure-drill runbook (section 12) in place.
- [ ] If you require HA: stand up the **active-passive** cluster (leader/standby on a shared
      server-database store — PostgreSQL or SQL Server) via the **section 14 HA rollout runbook** — VIP
      standup + both failover drills passed — and keep HA at the DB tier too. Decided and rehearsed
      before you depend on it.

---

## 12. Day-2 operations & monitoring

**Verify-it-runs (after every start/restart):** `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok"}`, send a synthetic
message, and confirm the **"wiring started"** banner in `service.out.log`.

**Monitoring surfaces:**
- `/metrics` — operational metrics for scraping.
- `/stats` — outbox counts by status.
- `/status` — DB size vs disk free, journal mode, counts. **Scrape db-size-vs-disk-free.**
- `/status/integrity-check` — on-demand store integrity.
- `/ws/stats` — ~1 Hz queue-depth WebSocket.
- `/messages` + `/messages/{id}` — per-message detail and the **event trail** (read this, not just the
  status — see section 7).
- `/dead-letters` — **page on dead-letter accumulation.**
- **AlertSink events** to alert on: `connection_stopped`, `queue_buildup`, `storage_threshold` (wire
  these to webhook/email — section 7).
- **`service.err.log`** — watch it.

The desktop console includes **Alerts** and **Dead-Letters** pages for in-UI alert management and
dead-letter triage; the CLI/API remain available for scripted operations.

**Log management:** logs land under `<DataDir>\logs`. Configure rotation, keep the level at `INFO` or
above (DEBUG can leak PHI — section 6), treat `service.out/err.log` as **potential-PHI artifacts** (ACL
them), and include them in your retention policy.

**Graceful drain for maintenance:** stopping the service (Ctrl+C / service stop) triggers the ASGI
lifespan to call `engine.stop()` for a clean drain. Always **drain → stop → back up → change → restart →
verify**.

**Failure-drill runbook — rehearse these in the lab/staging before prod:**

| Symptom | First moves |
|---|---|
| **Stuck FIFO lane** (retry-forever head) | `queue_buildup` alert → inspect `/messages` for the head → fix-and-`replay`, or `dead_letter_now` to unblock the lane (the dead row stays replayable). |
| **Poison message** | It dead-letters under `CONTINUE` (or stops the lane under `STOP`) → triage via `/dead-letters` → fix the transform → replay. |
| **Full disk / `storage_threshold`** | Free space / tighten `[retention]` / VACUUM → confirm `/status` disk-free recovers. |
| **Crash / unexpected restart** | Startup auto-recovers in-flight rows → verify `/health`, the "wiring started" banner, and that backlog drains. |
| **Planned maintenance** | Drain-and-stop (graceful), perform the change, restart, verify. |

---

## 13. Upgrade & rollback

**Safe upgrade runbook (pinned-wheel model):**
1. **Drain** inbound (quiesce senders or stop accepting new work) and confirm queues are draining.
2. **Stop** the service (graceful).
3. **Back up** the store **and** the encryption key (section 10).
4. **Bump the pinned engine version:** update the pin in your config repo's `requirements.txt`
   (`messagefoundry==<new>`) and `pip install "messagefoundry==<new>"` into the deployment venv.
5. **Re-validate:** run `messagefoundry check` against your config (and `ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest` too if you
   develop the engine).
6. **Restart** and **verify** (`/health`, "wiring started" banner, `/status`).

**Rollback:**
- **Config rollback** is the cheapest lever: the audited `POST /config/reload` does a quiesce-and-swap
  to a known-good `--config` directory (confined to the allow-listed reload roots). Keep your last
  known-good config dir available.
- **Engine rollback:** re-pin the prior version (`pip install "messagefoundry==<prev>"`) → restart (same
  runbook above).
- ⚠️ **Schema/store-level changes are not trivially reversible** against a populated store given the
  greenfield-only posture (no in-place migration). Plan code/config rollback as your primary path; use
  **dead-letter replay** to recover messages that a bad transform stranded before the rollback.

**Release cadence:** pin a released version (`messagefoundry==X.Y.Z`); the **latest release** is the
supported target. Reproduce a problem against the latest release before filing an issue, and keep
upgrades **small and frequent** rather than large and rare.

---

## 14. High availability — rollout & VIP standup runbook

**Single-node is the default and is genuinely reliable** — the durable staged queue (section 7), not
clustering, is what guarantees no message is lost on one node. Reach for HA only when you need
**failover** (an unattended node loss must not stop intake), **not** for throughput (for that, scale
intra-node — see the end of this section). When you do need it, MessageFoundry ships an **opt-in
active-passive cluster** — the supported HA model. This section is the operational runbook; the
authoritative topology, lease semantics, and full settings catalog are in
[CLUSTERING.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/CLUSTERING.md).

**The model in one paragraph.** Run N identical engine processes against **one shared server database**
(PostgreSQL or SQL Server) with `[cluster].enabled = true`. Exactly one node — the **leader/primary** —
runs the whole message graph (every listener *and* the router/transform/delivery workers); the rest are
**warm standbys** that only contend for leadership (heartbeat + cache convergence), binding no listeners
and running no workers until they win it. A **self-fencing leadership lease** in the shared DB elects the
one primary and guarantees a partitioned old primary stops before a standby takes over. There is no
separate broker and no node-to-node socket — coordination rides the shared `[store]` connection.

### 14.1 Stand up the cluster

1. **Pick a server-DB backend and make the DB tier itself HA.** `[store].backend = "postgres"` or
   `"sqlserver"` (SQLite is rejected for clustering). MessageFoundry coordinates the *processing*
   leader; it does **not** replicate your store — delegate store HA to the database (**PostgreSQL
   streaming replication / managed-Postgres HA**, or **SQL Server Always On**) and rehearse a DB
   failover separately.
2. **Provision every node identically.** Same installed engine version, the **same config dir**, and the
   **same `[store]` target** (server/database/schema) on each host. Set `[store].pool_size ≥ 2`
   (**≥ 3 recommended** — the leader drives the maintenance loop + reclaim sweep + workers
   concurrently).
3. **Enable the cluster** in the shared `messagefoundry.toml`:
   ```toml
   [cluster]
   enabled = true
   heartbeat_seconds            = 10.0   # keep the invariant: heartbeat < fence < ttl
   leader_fence_timeout_seconds = 20.0   # a leader that can't renew self-fences here (split-brain guard)
   leader_lease_ttl_seconds     = 30.0   # a standby may acquire only once the lease has expired
   ```
   The defaults trade a ~30 s crash-failover for margin; lower all three **proportionally** for faster
   failover at the cost of tolerance for a slow DB / GC pause.
4. **Sync clocks (NTP).** Row leases use node wall-clock — keep nodes synced so a lease expiry isn't
   mistimed. (Leadership is evaluated on the *DB* clock, so it's skew-immune; the row leases are not.)
5. **Start the same `serve` command on every node** (run each as its own Windows service — see
   [SERVICE.md](https://github.com/MEFORORG/MessageFoundry/blob/main/docs/SERVICE.md)). Confirm
   membership: `GET /cluster/nodes` lists every node and names exactly one `leader_node_id`; each node's
   `GET /cluster/status` reports `role: "primary"` on one and `"standby"` on the rest.

### 14.2 Stand up the VIP / load balancer (required)

Like other clustered interface engines, senders must reach "the engine" through a **floating VIP / L4
load balancer**, never a fixed node — because **only the primary binds the inbound listener ports**, the
VIP is what makes a failover transparent (modulo a reconnect). **MessageFoundry ships the bind behavior
and the `/cluster/*` endpoints, but does not ship a load balancer** — you stand one up (keepalived +
IPVS, HAProxy in `tcp` mode, an F5, a cloud **L4 / network** LB, …).

**Data plane (MLLP / raw-TCP / X12 inbound) — one VIP per listener port:**

- [ ] **Mode = L4 / TCP pass-through.** These are byte streams — do **not** front them with an HTTP/L7
      LB.
- [ ] **Health check = a plain TCP connect to that exact listener port** on each backend node. Because
      only the primary binds the port, exactly one backend is ever healthy, so the VIP routes there
      automatically; on failover the old primary's port closes (goes unhealthy) and the new primary's
      opens (goes healthy) and the VIP follows. An application-level (MLLP-message) probe is
      unnecessary — a TCP connect is the correct, sufficient signal.
- [ ] **Tune the probe to your failover budget.** The VIP repoints in roughly
      `check_interval × unhealthy_threshold`; size it well under your acceptable outage and above your
      DB/GC jitter (a 2–5 s interval is typical).
- [ ] **If MLLP-over-TLS is on, keep TLS end-to-end** (TCP pass-through) so the engine's own cert is
      presented; don't terminate TLS at the VIP unless you re-encrypt to the backends.
- [ ] **Don't let the LB reap long-lived MLLP sockets** — set TCP idle timeouts generous enough for
      persistent connections.
- [ ] **Verify every partner reconnects-on-drop.** On failover, connections to the old primary drop and
      senders must redial the VIP. This is standard MLLP client behavior — confirm it per partner.

**Management plane (console / IDE → engine API) — optional VIP:**

- [ ] The API is a control/read plane over the shared DB and is **up on every node**, so an API VIP can
      health-check the unauthenticated **`GET /health`** (liveness); you can point the console at any
      node.
- [ ] To pin operators to the active leader, read **`GET /cluster/status`** → `role`
      (`primary`/`standby`) or **`GET /cluster/nodes`** → `leader_node_id` / `lease_owner` (the console
      already surfaces the live primary). Both endpoints need only `MONITORING_READ` (VIEWER and up; no
      PHI).

### 14.3 Rehearse & validate failover (before real traffic)

Failover is **not instantaneous** — quantify *your* window from these drills; don't assume
zero-downtime.

- [ ] **Clean switchover** (planned): gracefully stop the primary's service. It **expires its lease**, so
      a standby promotes on its next heartbeat (**≈ one `heartbeat_seconds`**). Watch `leader_node_id`
      move on `/cluster/nodes`, watch the VIP repoint, and keep synthetic traffic flowing throughout.
- [ ] **Crash** (unplanned): hard-kill / power off the primary. Its lease **ages out**, so a standby
      promotes after **up to `leader_lease_ttl_seconds`** (~30 s default); a partitioned old primary
      **self-fences within `leader_fence_timeout_seconds`** so it can't double-process. Confirm the new
      primary's **owner-scoped on-promotion recovery** re-pends the dead primary's in-flight rows
      immediately (delivery resumes without waiting out the per-row lease TTL).
- [ ] **Zero-loss across the failover.** At-least-once means a row interrupted mid-delivery is
      **re-delivered** after its lease expires — so confirm your downstream connectors **dedupe / are
      idempotent**, then reconcile sent-vs-delivered across the drill.
- [ ] **Record the measured window** and, if needed, tune `heartbeat < fence < ttl` down proportionally
      and re-drill.

### 14.4 HA go-live checklist

- [ ] Server-DB backend; **DB-tier HA configured and its own failover rehearsed**.
- [ ] Identical engine version + config dir + `[store]` target on every node; `pool_size ≥ 3`; **clocks
      NTP-synced**.
- [ ] `/cluster/nodes` shows all nodes and exactly one `leader_node_id`.
- [ ] **VIP per inbound port** with a **TCP-connect health check**; partner **reconnect-on-drop**
      verified.
- [ ] **Clean-switchover drill** passed (≈ one heartbeat, VIP follows, zero loss).
- [ ] **Crash drill** passed (failover within the TTL, no double-processing, in-flight rows recovered,
      zero loss).
- [ ] Measured failover window documented; lease timings tuned to your network.
- [ ] **Config changes applied as a coordinated (non-rolling) restart** — all nodes restart together so
      they never run divergent graphs across the change window.
- [ ] `/cluster/status` + `/cluster/nodes` monitored (alert on **no live leader** beyond a failover
      window) alongside the section 12 surfaces.

**For throughput (not failover), scale intra-node:** one independent delivery worker per outbound
connection (a slow/failing lane never blocks siblings), and keep retry policies finite where
head-of-line blocking on a shared FIFO lane would otherwise stall throughput. Adding cluster nodes does
**not** raise throughput — only the leader processes.

---

## 15. Getting help & reporting bugs

- **Bugs & feature requests:** open a GitHub issue using the repository's issue templates
  (`bug_report.md` / `feature_request.md`).
- **Security vulnerabilities:** use the repository's **private security advisory** process per
  `.github/SECURITY.md` — do **not** open a public issue for a vulnerability.
- **Before filing:** verify against the latest release, and include the engine version, config shape,
  and relevant **non-PHI** log excerpts.
- 🔒 **Never attach real PHI** to an issue, log excerpt, or reproduction. Reproduce with a synthetic
  corpus from `messagefoundry generate`.

---

## 16. Decommissioning an environment

Tearing down an environment is a **PHI-disposal** event. `uninstall-service.ps1` removes the service but
**deliberately leaves the store and logs on disk**. To tear down cleanly:

1. **Graceful drain + stop**, confirm no in-flight work remains.
2. **Uninstall the service** (`scripts\service\uninstall-service.ps1`).
3. **Securely dispose of all PHI-bearing artifacts:** the store (`.db` + `-wal` + `-shm`), any
   PostgreSQL database/backups, **File-connector spill directories**, the `logs` directory, every
   **backup copy**, and the **encryption key / DPAPI key file**.
4. **Revoke credentials** (service account, AD bind account, any API tokens).

Treat backups and the encryption key with the same disposal rigor as the live store — a forgotten
encrypted backup plus its escrowed key is still recoverable PHI.
